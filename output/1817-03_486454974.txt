ON THE NECESSITY OF REFORMThe Scotsman (1817-1858)ON THE- NECESSITY OF REFORM As moral liberty is tho prime blessing of man in his private is civil liberty in his public capacity There is nothing that requires more to be watched than power There is nothing that ought to be opposed with more determined than its Sleep in State as Montesquieu say is al nays followed by slavery Dr Price OUR last number short view of the Parliamentary history of this reign to the end of the American war We observed that the increased power of the Crown at the accession of his present Majesty enabled Ministers to adopt a-new system of Government by Court patronage and treasury influence This change in our policy first clearly shewed tlic country that the representation in the House of Commons was defective From the Revolution to the era in question the advisers of the Crown were generally chosen from the popular party The quiet accession of the House of Hanover had been owing to the wise and decisive measures of the Whigs of that day and the two first princes of that dynasty not have maintained themselves on the throne against the desperate machinations of tlic Tones and other friends of the exiled family if they had not identified their support with that of liberal and nary principles This alliance was however unnatural and merely arose out of peculiar circumstances The Whigs might have foreseen that whenever the Tones lost all hopes of restoring they would seek to ingratiate themselves with the reigning family -they might also have foreseen that as soon as the power of the Crown dangerous competitor it would rather choose for its advisers men animated with liberal ideas who must have been aggrandisement The services too of the great somewhat uncourtly in their conduct towards royalty was established and freed from men of slavish and servile principles than thwarting and cramping its views of families to the House of Hanover had perhaps rendered them They says Mr well as confer an obligation Tlic influence of leaders of parties became in many cases an accession rather to that influence which would otherwise have been possessed as in BUBKE as if tlie Court could receive as Government thus divided in appearance between the Court and tlie the popular than to the royal scale and some part of sort of mortmain and domain returned again to tlie great ocean from whence it arose and circulated among of men of great natural by the true lovers of despotism to ai ior power held ly am means annihilate all intermediate situations between boundless strength on

debility on tlic part of tlie As soon therefore as tlie Whigs they were dismissed from administration Tlie Torics to their of royalty the Whigs may rest assured Court could go on without tlic and as

and corrupt state representation at the close of the American war and briefly noticed some of tlie efforts he made to procure its amendment we shall not therefore enlarge at present on but content ourselves with 1760 to 1783 We have there given Mr PITT opinion making few observations on some later events Tlie French revolution was hailed with cordial sympathy by great portion of the wise the good and the great inen of this country They rejoiced that 2 millions fellow men had thrown off the galling chains of an odious and unprincipled despotism and they 0 ir themselves that neighbouring nation had at length imitated-the bright example given in tlic British revolution of 688 But the Tory faction to whose princip les Mr PIT was now converted looked on this event witli very different feelings remembrance of the mischiefs entailed on tlie public by the ministerial majorities during the American war as it had established the necessity had also stimulated the desire of reformation Tlie success of the French people in overturning their feudal tyranny communicated an additional energy to the popular party in Britain and the Tory faction perceived violent measures must be taken to repress tlic rising spirit or that it would prove too strong to be afterwards put down To accomplish this base design all tlie engines of government influence -were set in motion Tlic violences of tlie French revolution chiefly from the previous debasement of that people were-held up to intimidate tlic higher classes The men who rejoiced in this event were stigmatised as wishing to sub vert all overturn the foundations society The Torics order and of regular government nnd their opponents were branded witli crew of scribblers could invent -These artifices weakened and the Tory faction resolved on war which real object entered into to suppress all liberty easily subverted at home TBfigion Dr Price was of tlic number and to were exclusively denominated the friends of social every
