ON THE FREEDOM OF TRADEThe Scotsman (1817-1858)ON THE FREEDOM OF TRADE If foreign country can supply us wi cheaper we ourselves can make it better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our

would have no foreign commerce Fortunately however for the civilization and improvement of mankind no single nation is thus situated Tlie differences of soil and of climate give rise to an infinite variety in the natural productions of remote and with thousand others diversity to even of contiguous territories while these circumstances surprising extent the products of manufacturing industry Without therefore it is evident individual by their neighbours and is also the of- commodities will be distributed over the world wants of the different societies and the capital employed on those

unfounded But this argument if it deserves name cannot be applied establishing perfect other brandies of commerce Why should we not for ex ip le be allowed to purchase French silks if they be for less sum we can afford to manufacture them for Unless this is tlie case no person would import silks and if we arc not permitted to purchase them in tlic cheapest markets our silk wearers must pay an high price for their silks and smaller proportion of our fair countrywomen will have it in power to clothe themselves with this splendid and showy dress But this is not all Part of the capital and labour of tlic country must be wrenched out of its natural employment and our foreign trade must be diminished for if we will not buy from foreigners foreigners buy from us and in proportion as oil purchases

Our restrictions have raised our own Ow zeal to prop up and support true we never can have that beneficial intercourse if we had sooner adopted policy It to course which lias already been we persevere
