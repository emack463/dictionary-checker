BURGH REFORM--NECESSITY OF A CHECK ON THE EXPENDITURE OF THE BURGH FUNDSThe Scotsman (1817-1858)BURGH REFORM-NECESSITY OF CHECK ON THE RE QF BURGH FUNDS Therene vr was tlie minds of men were more on this ng topic than now were moru its discussion Mn PiiT THE right of the repres tives of the people assembled -in Parliament notonly to vote the annual supp lies required by the exigencies of the state but also to examine into the manner in which they have been app lied has been justly considered as bF the greatest public benefit Without this salutary control there could be no security that those sums which had been granted for fitting out-an armament for carrying on some national improvement orfor any similar object mig ht not have been directed to the baser purposes of glutting the cupidity and pampering the bloated court parasite The power- of granting supplies divested of the farther power ot examining their appropriation could not Jin Jact be any utility Arid -the society be large or small whether it be or if is essential to ifs-good gover nment that an efficient control should exist over tlie expenditure of the public moneys -J- TheJ uth of these remarks agitated question- of Burgh But when this admission-has been made it is no Scotland- Iiave any power to money levied from them for the are in the situation of masters who have to trust solely CEinhot detect and which which enter deeply into tlie present much Kefonn wi nRt it is presumed be disputed mortify ing to reflect that the Burgesses of examine into the manner iri wh ich the common good as it is termed is expended They have no check on their servants and to tlic honesty of those whose th ey if they were detected they coul not punish How such system as this so pregnant with absurdity screen peculation should have been suffered and seemingly contrived drily to to exist so long is really It is in vain to tell us burghs have been managed as well and their economically as they could havebeen wholly gratuitous and is attention What should we think of minister who should had disposed of Jive or ten that the affairs of tlio different close funds applied as ju and ny system of control Every such assertion -as this is not to the least refuse to render any account of the way in which he millions of the public money the expenditure had been really judicious if it-had been for objects of why should he or should body refuse to submit his opposite course is followed wherever public funds are whose different transactions are we have an unquestionable rig ht to to those of individuals and that sole object of their attention advantage the treasurer of any public accounts to the public inspection Wherever an managed by self-elected Junto religiously kept secret conclude that tlie public interests have been has been the primary if not the But we are not left to general conclusions however certain and indisputable The distress to which the present of Aberdeen and which threatens to wide-spread mischief and wretched system has alread led in the case overwhelm Dumfries and many other Burghs It is worthy -k however that the enormous amount of their debts never induced the Magistrates of those cities to abate any portion of their accustomed expenses On the contrary is too notorious to behere insisted on when their had increased to an extent which must have extinguished every idea of paying them pff those worthy conservators pf the public purse rather increased in prodigality swaggered at tavern as usual df the prosperity of their gude towns at ie instant they were plunged in the bankruptcy What has happened at Aberdeen may happen at Edinburgh at Glasgow or at any other Burgh The public money may be misapplied or it maybe entirely dissipated and an immense debt contracted by men over whose extravagant and wasteful proceedings the public have not the smallest check These considerations ought surely to stimulate tlie inhabitants of every Burgh in Scotland to imitate the example of Montrose and Dundee by endeavouring to make an end of such an absurd-system But th ere are other considerations of still Iiiglicr importance which must not be lost sight -The Jhave had the ss to contend inhabitants have npt onl ht to control to the Corporation but that th lf by the Magistrates of Dumfries the 11 I- them in the what they term the funds blc collectively and individually Magistrates Now if this be really the law of the land if the Burgesses of the different Burghs contracted by their local Burgh system are individually liable for the debts rulers we should conceive must be very short-lived indeed -It is impossible that any set of Burgesses enslaved can ever submit to such system of those very funds to they grievance but every city must be deserted where persevering industry and exertion may be ruined and irresponsible magistracy however poor spiritless arid of munici pal government To have no concern in the disposal contribute is sufficiently that fortune which has been accumulated by the extravagance and profusion of Any thing additional add much weight to that no really honest and we might urge could not no stated It may however be upright Magistrate -ho man in short who does not as mere mean of recommending himself to some possibly any objection to such reform in to the public an effectual control the public money None hate tlie li ght public money lias been really and bond fide expended consider his magisterial situation and of making fortune can the present corrupt system as would give over the expenditure of except those whose deeds are dark If the for the public service the accounts public Till this begone fair and just reward -the public gratitude The mass of mankind why not make honourable conduct will never meet with its proper and will always and for the most part too with perfect justice conceive touching pecuniary matters which is most meritorious efforts of tlic best of men must distrust for it will be if they felt perfectly at case about their conduct public It is fortunate that honest frank and portion of deception and deceit to be involved in every transaction cautiously veiled from all inquiry The in such circumstances be viewed with jealousy and naturally considered that they would rather rejoice at having it made open pro- 1- V- ceedings can alone recommend any man or set of men to the public esteem Let line of conduct therefore be adopted by trates of our Burghs if theyhave any desire to stand yell- in-lHe of they fellow-citizens Let and pictures voted by heir self-elected them seek an re tu rn fpr services in the applause and esteem of an intelligent and grateful public However general these remarks may be in their application we would wish them to be somewhat particularly attended to the Burgesses and Inhabitants of this city Though we have no means of knowing the precise extent of the revenue of the gude town its amount judging from thc wci ofthe local taxation must be very great But it may be it is expended unconnected with the public and even of this very few on ly are acquainted with the simple fact if the want of all expenditure of so-large sum
