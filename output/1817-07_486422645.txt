were received Not to enumerate many instances they would recollect that deeply impressed on tlie minds oFall who liad to be preferred this sentiment was received not by murmur House Was this anew sentiment Was it not one which had history He should wish to see one of those who joined in clamour stand forward and record his name and explain what would have been his sentiments respecting that which bad at other been tlie Glorious Itcvuliition but which these Gentlemen must have called treasonable conspiracy to prevent King James II from bringing about arbitrary power That Gentle man would also have the goodness to explain upon what princi ple of consistency lie could view the present occupant of tlie Throne in arty other light than that of an Usurper As to the case tlie subject of his motion two explanations had been given by tlie Ri ght Honourable Gentleman Mr AddingtonJ Short as that first ox planation had necessarily been it was expressive It seemed to disclaim all responsibility tor Right Honourable Gentleman Mr and the Secretary of State as to passed in the prisons in which the unfortunate men were committed on suspicion This doctrine he strongly protested against The Principal Secretary of State should be informed by some confidential person for whom lie was responsible of the state and almost tlie daily of those prisons Where was great power there was great responsibility Tlic Secretary of State would not be degraded by such employment could be more honourable than an attention to tlio state of men so incapable of protecting themselves The prisoners liad been deprived of the protection tiley derived from the visits of tlie Magistrates He conceived itmight be proper to prevent indiscriminate access but lie could not conceive how this principle could be carried far as to exclude his Honourable Friend Mr Bennet than whom more ul Member was not in the House Wliat could be the object of this If it were supposed that his Honourable Friciiil would enter into an improper communication with the prisoner the gaoler was at hand to prevent it It was painful to th ink in lew years so great change had taken place in opinions That he inan who had devoted his life to the examination et prisons to which he had been first directed by his official duty as Sheriff of Bedfordshire and to whom the doors of every prison in tile most barbarous Indoor of the prison of his own country shut in this by order of British Secretary of State Tins exclusion that general opinion seemed to prevail in the House because they were in prison for their offences in other words parts of Europe had been opened would now have had his face by the gaoler he had appointed and of all examination was one reason for his motion another was tlie complaints of these prisoners were not to be attended to that were Dut an opinion founded in tlie grossest injustice it any measure of precaution against escape injustice was done It one might as it was probable that some of tor punishment and repentance This was vas taken which was not purely of these men who was thus imprisoned them would be put to trial and acquitted not on any technical defect in tlie evidence not from any resistance an over strained accusation but from full conviction of the of those men whom he had thus confined to crimes him to go to that confinement to place himself melancholy hours of solitary darkness-to feel those family perishing for want of Ilis assistance would interrupt tlie less little as In tormentors ever to repent what lie lien should feel-who would tell him when resistance which he trusted every British Jury would make to innocence ot accused how would those feel who sent one of which he had not been guil ty who would tell on bed where he liad counted the agonizing pangs with which the recollection of ruined wife and gloom of his despair having to repent as and infinitely less than he was next impelled by Ilis selfish fears and misguided loyalty to qualify Ilis actions by some consideration with its enjoyments for despotism and its repose the people If there were any who would yet give up of England slavery with its its twa points in tlie Petition Tlie statement as to the irons he been sent to prison where it was the rule not-advert to the felons beds and the was fact which its minuteness rendered characteristic-he his flute It reminded them of llic story of tlie gaoler were nut yet prepared to bequeath to their posterity spies its standing armies He should refer to one or had not been satisfactorily explained Wliy had to put people in irons without special directions He should felons fare nor the beautiful arcade but there alluded to the order to deprive the prisoner of who killed spider which had been the amusement of an unfortunate being in similar confinement The prisoner stated his life It was impossible to say whether this was true the liberty the House in instances the life of inno cnt men Tlie guilt was upon the was curious the Ri ght Honourable Gentleman who to such punishment was afraid of libelling the gaolers by Suppose they were allowed pen and ink which the the circumstances of his confinement probably terminate but it was not improbable that instead of might give the power of puttin an end to head of those who voted for the mca- It could subject men some of whom were possibly innocent inquiring into their conduct It was said tlie prisoners might petition House at they to of whom had to least should be full sure of by whom were complain Mr said with respect to he Petition which was said to have been interrupted in its passage possession receipt in the form letter for that had been urged against the Noble Secretary of Slate was that every prison This however appeared an extraordinary assertion that Secretary complaint that might be sent to him inquiries into lie Conduct of gaolers and whether it for the prisoner to make complaints if his treatment had been no complaint had ever sent to the through the office of the Home Department he liad in Ilis Petition from Mr Harmcr Evans solicitor The other point which he ought to have been informed of the internal stale of of State who was so ready to hear every requiring redress of grievances should be compelled to make daily was consistent with the orders prescribed to them It was competent improper and tlie best answer to his own allegations was that He declared that pen ink and paper had never been refused to the prisoner There was an unlimited allowance of was provided sufficient for culinary purposes -Candles indeed were Much stress had been laid on depriving Mr Evans not to allow musicas it disturbed coals except in summer only issued under some restrictions and only on special authority of his flute it was however the rule of tlie prison others but Mr not make use of it and laugh was perfectly new and of better quality than those in dissatisfied with tilis lie might have had Ilis own bed to oppose the motion Mr SHAW liad this day called Evans might II TC had Ilis musical instrument if he did tke Omwsltim Tlie bed which Mr Evans used common use in Ihc prison but if Mr Evans were and Tlie Right Honourable Gentleman concluded willi expressing his intention at the prison and applied to every individual confined on of High Treason in order put question to each whether abstracted from tlie privation of conduct of tlie gaoler and the answer was decidedly No complaint was in deed made against the gaoler complaints which lie liad preferred yesterday refusal ol aa opportunity to enjoy air and exercise the depriving Mr Evans of Ilis flute were not the other side and therefore he hoped the grounds of these to tlie grounds of complaint He liberty he liad any fault to ind with tlie different from the House had heard last night or the Magistrates Mr BENNET said all tlie witli respect to prisoners namely as to the denial of coals and candles at certain hour and the only but distinctly admitted on complaints would be removed Mr EV declared that lie had never heard case of under consideration nor one which had so much tlie appearance of lie public mind Mr BENNET asked
