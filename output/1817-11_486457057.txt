Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)of such disgusting system can hope to even the shred of an argument With this view they will pretend that no burghs in which there is any difference of opinion or which are not disfranchised are in pari COSH with Montrosc But tin is mere drivelling Every one sees that if justice and expediency had not called for an improved set to Montrosc the circumstance of that Burgh being without Magistracy was no reason for altering its constitution some fiction of law which lawyers can best account for it is held that there is only one day in any one year thai an election of Magistrates can take place and that consequently if an election do not take or if an election then made electing reverts to tlie burgesses at large but who the Crown Hence the

been the practice of past years to load BONAPARTE with every species of abuse and we certainly are none of Ilis We hold him in abhorrence as one who never displayed any attachment to liberty but sacrificed it to the low and paltry ambition of beins esteemed Conqueror and an Emperor But we will venture to affirm that were every enormity committed by Inra in his various career in one point of
