Editorial Article 2 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)ALTHOUGH vie most respect the benevolent motives by which Mr OWEN is actuated in bringin forward bis plans for tlic relief of tlie poor and for vice anil mi sery froin tlio world still wo cannot help considering ihem as being altogether founded on wrong views of human nature The whole of Mr OwiiN and we regret that the length of his lately published paper on tlie subject prevents Inying it before our readers proceeds on the princip le of interference with individual industry exertion Now we conceive this to be and pernicious It lias been tlic fault of nil governments in every age of the world and of none more than our own to interfere too much witli the pursuits of individuals nnd to this more to any oilier cause is tlie misery existing in society to be ascribed Tlie humanity of tlic trainers of the English poor laws and of tlic English workhouse system cannot be called in question but surely it would been much better for England if these laws and workhouses hiid nover existed Man should in every case bo taught to depend on his own exertions and not to trust to factitious resources It is impossible in most instances

establishments containing from five hundred to fifteen hundred persons there to be furnished with employment to labour in common and to live in kind of primitive society Tilis is really with vengeance How is Mr OWEN to the apparently unemployed persons to be consigned to these abodes of bliss and how is tlie expense of them to be supported The industry of lie country cannot possibl be greater than its capital can et in motion and we confess we do not see how tlic building of myriads of poor-houses for sueli Mr OWENS communities would in fact be could afc all increase this fund We suspect it would have very different choose to pay enormous sums to support workmen where lie could have no control over them employ them under his own eye It does not seem very probable manufacturer would

capital abroad but every such expense attending tilis scheme is fortunately sufficient security to any extent But tlie country ought that its introduction if it were possible the lower classes it
