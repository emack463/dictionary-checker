Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)would wait tlic call of public convenience and take tlic direction which it pointed out Were the public voice acting regularly and constantly through some proper organ tlic wants of the community would always be faithfull expressed and attended to the indolence of magistrates would be stimulated and their precipitation checked The talent and public spirit existing among tlie citizens would find its way into official stations the character of the Magistracy would be raised and men in office being backed by the confidence and the resources of the community would be enabled to execute the greatest undertakings with facility Iii ascribing the evils of the present system to the practice of self-election we scarcely in the mode of choosing the Deacons because the accompanied witli so many restrictions as to render than the plan of direct nomination Tlic mortification they have reaped from the Magistrates by exerting their throwing out whom they selecting those for ordinary deacons think it worth while to notice the apparent exception privilege of tlic Trades in this particular it doubtful whether it is not greater evil know well how much trouble and this illusory privilege They know that among the members before election -by please in shortening the leets -and are most likely to prove servile or inefficient can effectually exclude any individual whom they could this show of not bend to their purposes and render election source of without producing the smallest public benefit Indeed we the situation of the Merchants who have by without any privilege at all than have such as are but and irritation to those wlio exercise them And when we recollect and jealous regulations is by excluding the contention to tlie Trades and of vexation to individuals should yp refer their representatives the Council because we would rather be mockery -leading to no other results than disappointment that the object of all those com citizens from the management of their own concerns to enable self-elected junto to pursue their the greater ease and security to screen corruption as the means are the end is still worse private interests at the public expense from obloquy and peculation from punishment we become sensible that bad The system are not mere hypothetical conclusions deduced from nearly three centuries since complaints of obliged the Scottish Parliament to provide though new acts were passed from time to Lord after refi to tlie various attempts made mischievous effects of the Burgh probable causes they are matter of history and experience It is corruption in Magistrates remedies by statute but time with this view tlie evil was never cured to reform tlic system speaks of tlie state of burgh government in In time in these terms The unhappy consequences of leaving any check or control arc too visible to be are seldom laid out for the good of tlic town are in possession of the magistracy and in pretext is laid hold of particularly idleness and corruption of manners tlie contagion confined within tlic town it -ca disguised The revenues of royal burgh but in making friends to the who rioting and for which of hosp to strangers Sucli mismanagement tends to arc remarkable in roost royal burghs or is spreads all around leaving magistrates to act without control Another consequence no less fatal of is strong desire in every licentious burgess of stepping into tlie magistracy for his and animosities prevail in all lie royal without tlie least regard to tlic good of the community own sake for that of his friends Hence llic factions burghs which arc and indecently pursued The in parliament habit of riot and by every adventurer wlio is willing to lay out money infamous of bribery at elections which tends not people but is still more dreadful tends manners void of probity and honour greatest evil of all respects the choice of their intemperance fit subjects to bo corrupted fur scat in Ucnco the only to corrupt lie whole mass of the to fill the House ol Coiuinons li men of dissolute The mystery that hangs over all burgh transactions excludes us from the knowledge of particulars but there are two notorious facts which arc tolerably decisive with regard to the spirit and tendency of the system The first is that almost every Burgh lias Jiad its property shamefully dilapidated by the members of Council selling or to one- another or to their friends portions of the common good greatly under their value Of this abuse are many instances in tlie of our own city probably few of recent date The other is that nearly all the Burghs whether their revenue be-great or small are loaded witli as much debt as it was found possible to contract without the concern In Aberdeen and Dumfries where this limit lias been exceeded the consequences are now visible and as insolvency seems to be tlie natural crisis of the system it is impossible to say how soon oilier Burghs may share tlie fate of these two unless the inhabitants avert the dangers by vigorous effort for timely reform Of the present state of the funds ofour own city City debt in 1798 was 160 years preceding that period had increased at the rate exceeding the revenue by that amount We Bailie SMITH wrote and as he was expelled for of economy it may be we know nothing but according to Bailie SMITH

that our improvements of late years scale and that the increase in the lias-gone on unchallenged ever since We shall have been executed on stipends of the clergy must have tin-own an additional burden of nearly 4000 in the Council the public may come to know readers may make tlie best they can of the facts we per annum on the funds When another squabble takes little of their own affairs but in the mean time our have alluded to and draw their own conclusions fifty or sixty years ago Lord KAMES 40 000 per annum but at amount to five times this sum The whole of this who are not responsible to the proceedings in any Court short of Parliament Lord KAMES About the revenues of the Royal Burghs at they may probably large revenue is managed public and cannot be called to account for their thought indeed tlie Court of Exchequer had the power of with burgh funds but when calling Magistrates to account for their the the Barons found gone nto disuse but they at the revenues and to fhc Iwgesses to relief In this state the matter stands and it seen whether there is enough among us to sei-ie the present favourable question was tried in February 1787 that the old act upon which tlie practice rested had same time admitted tlie nial-administration of the appl to Parliament for now remains to be sense and courage opportunity and by spirited and vigorous effort put an end to the complicated evils of the system
