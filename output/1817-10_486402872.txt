ON THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SPIRIT IN SCOTLANDThe Scotsman (1817-1858)ON THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SPIRIT IN SCOTLAND The best founded pride is debased to tlie dust if it endeavours to nake contemptible what is not so the best founded self-esteem is when it denies to others their true measure of respect WE remarked in one oF our early notices that the sin of our countrymen had teen an ence to political ri hts but we did-not intend by hat observation to give countenance to the vulgar that there is something inherently supple and lavish in the character of Scotsmen The stigma in our opinion unmerited and the indifference of we complained is now we trust more appa- ent than real For whatever be the strength of pu- lic spirit in Scotland it possesses almost no political institutions under which such spirit can be manifested The constitution of Scotland as was recently greatest authorities yeomanry generally from any share remarked by one of her excludes the traders manufacturers and in the election of Members of society without the middle ranks to rest upon how is of importance The number of electors altogether is so small so immense as those of Britain may to almost each voter something in prospect and the particularly those of tlie burghs are such as uf Parliament And without the mass any character to become useful or make himself that Ministers who have the patronage of national establishments either ive something in possession or hold out institutions themselves to draw no person to them but those who are hunting after or Lheir connections The field for political exertion witli such peculiar cast that the wonder is should be any wlio display small places for themselves is so narrow and occupied generally not that there are so few but hat there of independence

sublimity of his selection of his expressions place all doubt at the Iiead of living poets In all the fine poetical that are to be found poetry His poems in word like him beyond Ilis Pleasures of Hope

and inculcates become rather part of us than ours This liberty which he communicates from himself to his readers morn invidious mark And hate the light because your deeds arc thoughts And as these arc buoyant witli which he contrives delight the heart the magnanimous sentiments which he is peculiarly the case with tlie passion for Wrth him we would exclaim Ye that the rising dark Ye expanding truth

thus divine Here shall thy triumph Genius cease and liere Troth Science Virtue close your short career Tyrants in vain ye trace the wizard ring In vain ye limit mind unwearied spring Yes there arc uncreated dust Ordained to nre the sons of With with intellectual day The mazy wheels of Nature as And rival all but Mtespeare name below hearts prophetic Hope may trust That slumber yet in every charm of wisdom and of worth Ordained to play Or warm with fancy energy to glow It gratifying to Scotsmen to compare these sentiments of countryman illustrious for his the hy of the completely all is not incurious in itself and must be our great poet the coincident opinions of another contributions to human mind Mr STEWART after taking notice of those who abandoning speculative inquiries and suffering themselves to be carried quietly along with the stream of determine to amuse themselves the best way they can with business this scene of illusions goes on to remark But he who believes that reason was iven his happiness will despise the he is popular opinions and of fashionable manners or pleasure during their wlio thinks more favourably of the human powers and to man to direct him to his duty and of this timid philosophy and while conscious that he is guided in of truth -will rest assured that their result will be the best interests of mankind What indeed will his inquiries onl by the love equally favourable to his own comfort and to be the particular effects in the first instance of that general which the art of printing must sooner or spirit of reformation with it cannot of human sagacity to conjecture but unless we choose scepticism we must hone and believe of permanent disorder to the-world- and that cause to apprehend the by tlie imperfection of our present institutions to feel diffusion of knowledge later produce and of that fail to be accompanied it is beyond lie to abandon ourselves entirely to that the progress of human reason can never be source

being favourable to the supposition that destined to be for ever and absurdity demonstrates the tendency which there is to promises an eternal stability philosophy when it shall once have acquired the ascendant to support it by more These encouraging expectations stated with so much beauty and accuracy present us wit li reasons for being grateful to in behalf of just and liberal sentiments If it is no less possible to do so in favour of generous and heroic feelings of our na- the poet who interests the fancy and the heart thi can be done in favour of error Mr continues truth If it be possible to extinguish nil the ture by teaching us to connect the idea of them with those of guilt and impiety it is surely equally possible to strengthen them by establishing the natural alliance between our duty and our happiness If it be possible for the influence of fashion to veil the natural deformity of vice and to give to low and criminal indulgences the appearance of spirit of elegance and ot gaiety can we doubt possibility of connecting in the tender mind those pleasing associations witli pursuits that are truly worthy and honourable Our intention however was not to give the public lecture on morality but to afford some evidence that there are Scotsmen who cherish and inculcate liberal and independent princi ples and who have done much to fix the wavering opinions of the multitude and to impress their own characters on that of the age With tills view also we could still give the names ofu host of other great men natives of Scotland who have accelerated tlie progress of the age in science and letters But the fear of omitting the claims on our notice are so numerous deters us We may just add however that all the exertions of genius whether directed immediately to further tlic cause of freedom and dash down corruption or not are in llie end favourable to liberty and hostile to corruption The perusal of works of genius increases the susceptibility to receive impressions and wrong impressions becomes the greater are tlie chances for tlic Tliu diffusion ol knowledge and an increased energy of give additional consequence to the barriers against despotism are
