because of late lies have been almost uniformly of painful nature Those who make all subjects at all times secondary to mav go at once to our summary Por the present we to risk few remarks on any subject which should roost present itself and that not unnaturally was one with Scotland country which has all our best ishes md affections Love of country is passion not distinctive of any nation but the Scots we believe cherish it in 10 common degree and in ourselves we are not sme that it loes not amount to prejudice against all others It ha arc intimately with morals and manners and striking

presents us with equally strong of its encouraging the growth of all the Icnicr and amiable affections We have not examined and do not mean to examine metaphysically how far the manners of the Scots are iiH by their attachment to their native country or how much of attachment is to be ascribed to tlic peculiar characters of Scotisli scenery On these points we leave our renders to form own opinion But we could not refrain from adverting to tlic one and tlic other before taking notice of what we conceive to Iiavc been hitherto the peculiar and most valuable characteristic of our fair countrywomen -a of home and of all the domestic virtues -England may produce women with skins of as fine texture witli colours more exquisitely wrought and with features well if not better proportioned in the Low Countries we may see women witli full and eves and some dignity Fnmcc may abound in women possessed of eye sparkling witli wit and vivacity and exhibit faces and persons of tlie most perfect suid Italy may present tlie traveller with all that is in woman But our observation do not surpass those of all the nations we have named Riling up as -it were of tlie features greatly fails us if our own countrywomen vi-r nf wii in he with traits of sentiment indications of those affections render woman truly mother With capacity for visible in united witli health and youth

of complexion and form deficient in requisites and whnt nature has thus to great advantage but with taste and walking in which they excel as much as in expression our own ladies arc by no means given

by the temper and passions never fail to irradiate the render its expression interesting if not fascinating competent of knowledge or is still good sense ensure the regular discharge of all tlie have said and indeed our love of country would in our female friend and relations constant homes attractive and make nil joys to those countenance and Tliat our countrywomen generally have not failed in acquiring more important in acquiring under tlic guidance of domestic duties must be inferred from all we much weakened if we did not yet sec of those qualities render our of Our anxiety is to

elegance of manners These may be united arc now invaded fashion and tlic fashionable rage for we know on delicate topic Those wlio discuss We like neither but to certain extent must while its effects
