of those who arc juris called their representatives presents it is believed an anomaly in the annals of tins country ith That this political degradation is not however the worst of the evils attendant on and arising from tlio principle of self- For it is understood as the law country at present stands burgesses havo to call this s- Council to account for their in- of tiro property iind funds held bv them in trust for the property and funds actually belonging to tlie burgesses at large While the burgesses had the right of choosing their own representatives sufficient power of control -was vested in them Hut now thost representatives the community funds those wlio are equally interested therein with themselves but often in fallow-citizens control not only without the consent or advice of direct opposition to the ishes and interest of their The necessary result of this uncontrolled power of management economy have long since been remembered only in nann the public and foolish projects the common property disposed of to an enormous amount been contracted whereby most otherwise unnecessary some have been brought to this very verge of and practice in the Magistracy and Councils is that in most of tlio burghs in Scotland prudence and funds have been misapplied or squandered in unprofitable meet exigencies arising from tlic most imprudent management nd of the burghs have been loaded with taxes bankruptcy and others entirely Bill That if tilis power of contracting debts to an unlimited and indefinite amount is not put an end to if as it seems to be understood burgesses is liable to legal attachment in tlic event in danger of being utterly ruined by tlie actions atr iirs whom they cannot remove for misconduct and over whom onlv theoretical or imaginary witness the cases of debt lias beon contracted of upwards of in the law of Scotland tlie property ofthe individual of deficiency ofthe public funds individual arc of incn whom they never entrusted

necessary heavily taxed to make up this deficiency Thus -eight thousand pounds sterling and when the income proved inadequate expenses of tlie burgh lie inhabitants have been sdf- Council over whom the burgesses have no control have wasted the public funds and oblige the burgesses to make attempt to exculpate themselves by stating contracted tlie debt But it is not necessary the burgesses may have been with different recent measures but to Magistrates and Town-Councils have done before the root of the evil lile principle of however of the evil resulting thi refri in deserve act inhabitants to make up the waste of up tlic loss 7 th That tlie Magistrates aiid that it was their predecessors in ollice not at present to question the truth of this averment however dissatisfied point out the power exists of doing amiss What they may under the present system do again It is ill self-election that the blow must be struck Two recent instances to pointed out 1 st Tlie Council procured an as

received that neither tlic Gilildry Incorporation nor individual the burgesses by persons not of choice consequently are liable contribute to tlic tax under the Paving and gible law thereto tlic
