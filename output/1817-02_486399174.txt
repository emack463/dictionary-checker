the country After brief congratulation on tlie successful termination of the Nepaulesc war his Lori adverted to the internal situation of lie country und observed that however deeply to be regretted LS the di existed still there was this consolation it arose from temporary causes and would therefore be remedied ffl causes gradually ceased to operate The diminished demand for produce and manufactures at home arising from tlie frum long war to sudden peace tlie diminished demand in foreign for our manufactures arising Iroin their difficulties and or froin our having previously overstocked markets ill these causes operated to produce stagnation in our trade and in tlie dill branches of manufacture and employment stagnation which been felt at tlie termination of every war in which tlie country had been engaged but which was every reason to believe would in tlie present case soon cease to be felt It was unfortunately too true that evil disposed persons Iiad endeavoured to take advantage of tlie distress that existed amongst the and their passions hut lie rejoiced there was amongst of loyalty and subordination rendered them not easily led Lordship concluded by moving an

Noble Lords express even tlie amount to intolerable burdens we are enduring the causes and nature of tlie Nepaul war ul tlie campaign which brought it to termination to see in former Speech in announcing tlie renter importance Leaving however that tlie Address and of the speeches of lie Noble so fortunate as to agree with them In unison with the their confidence in continuance of peace with Foreign Powers am sure my Lords no one can rejoice more present enjoy is likely to be in any assurances Hie peace which we at lasting but confess 1 have no confidence ill the in the Speech from the Throne the probable termination of peace have great apprehensions on the tlie system of policy on which these assurances arc tlie greatest danger to the peace of Europe- The arrangements tlie basis of peace appear to mc to rights und independence of nations and to he dictates of and in tlie speeches of the Noble Lords with respect to subject for to me my ords it founded instead of tending to securer was fraught with made by his Majesty Government as been adverse to tlie true wisdom-tohave becn alien to all policy and justice to have been subversive of tlie freedom of another been dangerous with reference to their moral influence on Ilie British car luar Without having attained result of tlie arrangements made by his Majesty had partaken wns to make us tlie objects of our

duly to say believe tlie causes in general are more deeply rooted and arc of 11 more permanent nature than lie Noble Lords seem to The pressure is so -the taxation is-so intolerable-tlie embarrassment internal afl ai general-as to exhibit altogether spectacle unprecedented at the termination of uny tenner war That there were great and great lty at lie termination of tli American War 1 most certainly admit but contend distress and that difficulty were so in their so much more limited in extent and aft so more strong of remedy no comparison place my Lords ask you if at the termination aH as it is at present -Were the daily pen shing in the streets for want of taxation and the amount of such as it amounted only to twelve millions In whatever can be instituted between tlie two periods In the first of lie American War tlio population of the Empire was then closed Were the workhouses with paupers Were persons food and clothing And above au was the extent of the now is hear hear The whole taxation at that period years 1 the speech from the Throne that the country was manufactures and revenue Is that the case at present Is that roni the conclusion of the American war it was stated in enjoying the full blessings of peace in improved commerce the tenor of tlie speech frum the Throne to which our Lordships attention is now called The voted last year were thirty-five millions The Ways and twenty millions making for by and the resources for meeting it But my Lords if found to be still greater If from the one side we the receipts will not recur the result of it be recollected that this result proceeds on the calculation that was taken at that sum But it has not produced any deficiency of the is most alarming Die supplies Means voted to meet did not much exceed temporary means of above fourteen millions between the expenditure this subject be examined more closely the deficiency will be deduct the that will not recur and from the other the calculation will shew 1 deficiency of eighteen millions And let lie produce of the Consolidated Fund would be three millions It tiling Thin millions therefore must be added to tlie eighteen millions making total deficiency of twenty-one reduction of the national expenditure millions now come my Lords to consider the question of Taking the average produce of view of the subject as they are falling ofl if we were to look to tlie of the whole three millions arid halt Then my Lords ask to our situation at any former period hear hear of difficulty not adverted to in the Speech but the state of our paper currency which in consequence of tlie taxes for the two last years which is too favourable in produce with an accelerating velocity contend that Sinking Fund would still be deficiency of howit can be stilted that our present situation is comparable hear In addition my Lords remember that you have source principal and operative cause ot the quantity forced into circulation during the latter part ot the war became depreciated twenty-five per cent but silver No such difficulty as this existed at the close of restriction began to manifest themselves The Chancellor of the without absolute ruin to the country My Lords from to reduce the National Expenditure No Successive attempts were paltry shifts and expedients The is now restored to par with gold and the American war In 1810 however the evils of the Bank

our evils we have lately heard my the circumstances of the case it seems production of all the under which we now labour In Lords of Loan by the French Government Under all hardly possible that it could have been without some concurrence or interference on the part of Government His on tilis subject and are called upon to state not their support or sanction to the proceeding by the state of the currency While paper was abundant and required to pay the une taxation paper is weighs on manufactures on commerce on agriculture on wholly unprecedented In what manner are we to remove all oll cr Is it to be by loan or Ministers labour heavy responsibility to your Lordships did repeat my Lords that our difficulties are augmented depreciated the taxation wan raised and the country is now on par-with gold and silver Tilis every thing connected with tlie national prosperity to degree these evils Wliat new expedients have his Majesty Ministers to by borrowing on Exchequer bills or to what other source are we to look for relief The Speech talks could give Ministers credit for sincerity in this intimation ut of reduction in our establishments wish ci forget my Lords that promise last year hear hear hear Wliat lias been the lias elapsed since the last Not only has insult and irritate the determined and almost Are we then now to believe that Ministers arc sincere in this and-the other House of Parliament must impose on retrenchment very different from that adverted to in tlie made the same conduct of In Majesty Government in the interval which no reduction been matte but as if to expressed inattention to their voice on this subject has been evinced their disposition to retrench My ords them that duty hem hear hear We must insist on from the Throne We must insist on rigid
