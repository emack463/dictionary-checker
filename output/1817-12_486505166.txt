Front Page 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)WE have only room at present to hasty glance at one branch of the subject indicated- by the title of this article but as it is of paramount interest and opens up wide field of speculation we shall soon recur to it- The affectionate concern so manifested by the public at the untimely death of our amiable princess though not with- political considerations was chiefly tribute paid to her private worth In every point of view it is honourable to the national character and it serves better- than thousand ents to refute the calumnies of the Ministerial Journals -by shewing that the people of this country so far from harbouring any sentiment inimical to royalty are more than any other the world warmly attached to their when the latter possess qualities that entitle them to regard Virtue and goodness lose none Princes who adorn their high sentiment and elevation of character have charm to natures cannot resist In future times perhaps it very many parish churches the fate of this young of mixed multitudes -that it touched sects and opinions who may sentiment in the course of their lives of their fascination when placed on throne and with dignity of win the affections of mankind which even the most will scarcely be believed that in Princess drew tears from the the sympathies and united the hearts of men of the most never again be animated by one common But our present object is to throw few thoughts together on the political consequences of this the Heir Apparent he fills an important event of no ordinary interest He has indeed exercises no public functions directly by EO many separate interests by the Heir considerable effect -an effect which will vary causes which are pretty occurrence Whatever be the age or condition of station and his death is an scarcely any official existence as he but in government like ours where public proceedings are influenced the opinions held or Apparent will generally have very much according to circumstances From obvious he will generall be attached to the party of Opposition and as this secure and holds out the prospect of how soon in the situation adversaries it has the dominant party While the Princess lived way was nearly as as NT had an age human life naturall daughter on tlie other hand was young and long life Many circumstances of kind renders the power of Ministers less their being placed theyknow not nn obvious tendency to check the violence of the control pro duced in tin it could be in any situation Tlie PRINCE REGE considerably uncertain His possessed constitution which gave the fairest hopes of to her feelings had given her an aversion to the party in power and of her education from this aversion was strengthened by the nature which she had imbibed an ardent attachment to the principles of British freedom Then the generous warmth other disposition gave the ardour of passion to the convictions of her understanding while the-decision other character virtuous domestic habits afforded the best guarantee for consistency pf conduct and steadiness of principle With so many tiu 8 to engage bur affections and encourage our hopes her death may well be considered great ua calamity The case is greatly altered in the most essential ot these circumstances now that the DUKE of YORK is the presumptive successor to tlie throne He is indeed only one year younger than the Prince but this is not of much consequence except as it relates to the unsettling of- the order of- succession by -the repeated transmission of the Crown from one collateral brand to another -a subject upon which we cannot en ei here The fact of most immediate importance is thai as the Duke so far as Ins sentiments are is decidedly attached to the party y- power the reigning Prince anu the Heir Apparent are likely to concur in the same course of measures and Ministers are consequently to extend arrangements to the currency of two in Stcad of our The stability lhis gives to-an administration tin Edinburgh Reviewers consider as AO dangerous that in their opinion the constitution has scarcely among its ordinary resources any means of providing against it But we arc unwilling to think that our situation is quite so bad and we are not without that in this as in other cases real good may arise out of apparent evil We have no the change which has taken place will give whatever does this and takes from our liberties when so strong disposition exists an evil of the most serious description but was in -a certain degree -a equally

should give to the national voice something like its just weight in Parliament then the crisis which at pre sent wears so unpromising an aspect would-reall be the dawn of future concord and prosperity True wisdom no less than magnanimity enjoins this line ol conduct at tlie present moment Those who are able to construe tlie signs of the times cannot fail to perceive that withholding from the people atlarge such an increase of power as increased gence wealth and force entitle them to -a great anc is almost certain There ii but one means of averting such crisis The Whigs with the people must ought
