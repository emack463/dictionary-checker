Editorial Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)We request the particular attention of our readers to the acc ount of the proceedings of the Common Council of London given in another column of this paper on the subject of Special Juries They are of the greatest importance inasmuch as the expose system hostile to our best interests and pregnant with the most destructive and ruinous consequences We have lately-said and we repeat it again that there can be no excellency or even security in Jury Trial if the Jurors be not fairly and impartially selected Unless this is really the case we cannot but view this institution as the most efficacious of all the supports of despotism It is natural that Judges-should have leaning or bias in favour of Ministers and consequently in favour of the measures of those Ministers to whom they owe their elevation to the Bench But the security and independence of their situation their rank in society the publicity of our legal proceedings and the intelligence of the Bar preclude any great risk of Judges by becoming the undisguised persecutors ofthe The maior part of them are known onl in their character opponents of Administration With Jurymen however the case is altogether different narrow circle and of course have no public character to support That feeling of honest independence and that so congenial to the minds of the great body are no doubt amply the urity of fairly that is love of fair dealing and of conduct of the people of Britain sufficient guarantees for judicial proceedings provided Jurors are indifferently or chosen But if this is not tlie case if the servants of the returning officer in making up lists of Jurymen should ever be able to the the very fountains of justice must be poisoned and it is lent that this species of trial must then afford from one Judges holding their situations-for life In the latter case with impartiality but in the other we condemned by already determined on their verdict and who have been sent into far less security than would be conducted solely by we should at least have some chance of are iri fact tried or rather junto who have Court merely that they may gut it recorded No kind of proceeding can be conceived more infamous than this It were better that we were at tried by our accusers for the atrocious mig ht be named for such purposes is apt
