might issue in the crime of sedition Every act speech or writing suited to vilifying the Sovereign in his public function and with the Government-the traducing or impugning the dignity of denying that

constitution It elective franchise was dail becoming more extended instead represented and that without total overthrow of the Constitution universal suffrage never could be conceded The effect of universal suffrage too was known the sad and neighbouring country where it had produced anarchy and the nobility and the destruction of the Church even overthrowing the church -There was also an

expressions iis ed in the speech except as to one passage Jury on tlie part of pamphlet even in part of it which is said the speech only that ho wus accused Now if Parliament however warmly strongly expressed It was not possible to express such grievances as were meant government but that the aggrieved had right to without being described There was no evidence of tlie actual and that only by the testimony of one witness Tlie Learned Counsel here commented on till expressions of by the Lord Advocate to the King himself This was Ministry or the Oligarchy The petition in embryo and petition is

deuce of his fellow-citizens It has been proved that he political discussions which convinced those engaging with him in it debates that lie was well affected to Government It is in the in vestigation of all crimes of importance to consider there situation mint lean to tlic conclusion that he could not mean avoid perceiving the general cala He imagined these Parliament He concurred therefore in the pro jcct of general the permission of the magistracy and the magistrate dread cd no nor was he answerable on that account for expressions pub licly so long ago as December 1816 No disturbance had It was long after that coin motions arose in the south wai felonious intention Now tlie whole of this man to disturb the Gorerii Baird however could not were in part owing to th want of im representation in meeting to deliberate on petitioning Parliament but this with mischief Baird no doubt attended the meeting but that legal others He did not speak himself Tlio meeting took place at time in -my part of the kingdom and at last this village transaction lias been brought forward by the public prosecutor and respectable mii peaceable man sedition is that there was felonious intention Tlie -e evidence of intention is not to be expected has been arraigned for sedition The essence of the crime of therefore must be cautiously attended to Direct and but the facts and circum supposition if made that the inten tion had been wicked and facts the felonious intention is evident from the facts themselves as committed with the intention of producing discontent or disturbance in the disturbance has actually happened but then the acts any other object It is not thea enough that the stances must at least support the felonious Here there is no room for that supposition Of many in the cases of murder and forgery Sedition is any act people It is not necessary to shew that must have the tendency obviously and without measures of Government are arraigned Disscntinn is not in itself tremendous tiling There is known in this country and constitution There arc no doubt excesses such may be committed to abolish the Christian religion-to depose the King were the object of the petition to bo proposed to

which is the physic of our even in deliberating for petitioning Parliament Suppose petition to Parliament -for common interest in wives and such -or carried into effect by force-this would be be impracticable it is not illegal to think otherwise and to pose and to express that the country is not fairl saidthat the words used admit of uu no defence It would be most unjust to take particular words in the speech or statement without attending to the others Some of the expressions are very improper but they are they may till not be seditious Let the combat in trampling upon the necks of reformers The words in the to be renounced applies to the whole people the constitution but that is subject which ought Lord Meadowbank speech in Fysche Palmer case The true under the pretence of petitioning Parliament -Mr Jeffrey the definition of sedition from Hmne and not seditious is not enough that expressions are politics be by speeches of an opposite tendency not petitions do not imply resistance The allegiance not to the petitioners and the supposition made is consistent with to be treated as mystery The learned counsel here quoted question is-was there an actual intention of exciting disturbances the language of the speeches with that view and read the examples quoted by that author all suppose actual resistance of the government to have been proposed or advised was obvious nothing was meant but to persist ie nrti -i-- u--u UWLttU 11 But from the whole of the speeches in the pamphlet it As to the used hv thi expression was quite opposite The orator thought the
