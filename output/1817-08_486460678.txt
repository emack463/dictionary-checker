and political feelings of the European nations than any other that could be mentioned It is impossible to look at the vast multitudes all conditions and professions who are throwing up their prospects in their native country and crowding to the land of promise without sensation of wonder It is spectacle without parallel since the time of the Crusades and in describing it we might adopt the language of the Princess and say that Europe appears torn up by the roots to be precip upon America The time too is remarkable No sooner has peace restored mankind to the undisturbed exercise of industry and

description Indeed we believe no careful and honest observer will deny that as the love of religious liberty first planted civilization in the American solitudes so it is the love of civil liberty
