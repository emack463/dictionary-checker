SMITH occasions in well-governed society that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people Every workman has great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what lie himself has occasion for and every other workman being exactly in tlie same situation he is enabled to exchange great quantity of his own goods for great quantity or what comes to the same thing for the price of great quantity of theirs He supplies them abundantly with what they occasion for and they accommodate him as amply witli he has occasion for and general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society The discoveries of Sir perhaps the roost beneficial of any made during tlie last century so far lowered the previous price of kingdom to wear that and elegant dress And
