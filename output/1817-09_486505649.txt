purpose and caution of procedure winch-mark tlie English character in its most perfect and happy combinations Having so much of the prudent it may be allowed to want tlie magnanimous virtues If its sensibility is not moved by every appearance of public distress it is because it acts Troni Mr BURKE calls long-si and strong-nerved humanity and if it rarely does great action under generous impulse
