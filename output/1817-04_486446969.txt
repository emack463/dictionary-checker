the sources of our wealth and of any comforts not yet wrung Trom us with the sources of our misery every step we take to relieve ourselves will only increase our difficulties and wretchedness strong feeling of the vital importance of this distinction has suggested to us tlie propriety of offering few remarks respecting tlie advantages of machinery to the notice of our readers We have seen with mingled sensations of pain and astonishment that not only the labouring classes whose irritation on this subject might well be excused but that persons in the hi her walks of life and with some pretensions to superior information have countenanced the pernicious and destructive idea that considerable part of the present distresses is ascribable to whnt they are leased to term the too great extension of machinery Such ridiculous dogma might in ordinary times be safely despised but in tlie present state of the country it may become extremely injurious and it is the duty of every writer for the public to endeavour to expose its absurdity To the same thing as to object to tlie reducing the will ever vest capital in machinery unless it enables goods cheaper to market But surely those contrivances which which obtainable with less of in that when machine for ging the hands which had previously been object to the improvement of machinery is price of commodities No manufacturer him to

of spinning jennies in 17 7 tlie value of the cotton goods in tlie kingdom only amounted to about 200 000 and not more than 50 000 spindles were employed The price of cottons was then so hi gh that very few people were able to purchase them and they had almost no sale abroad JIhc discoveries however of AiiKwniGHT and other ingenious men having as been lately computed produced saving of ninety-nine parts out of hundred in the labour formerly necessary in this manufacture the consumption of cotton goods has increased so prodigiously that notwithstanding an immense fall in their prices
