sanguine in expectations and afterwards in consequence of unforeseen difficulties to sink too far under their disappointments strong sympathy with the fate and interests of others impels them to labour for the public good and they naturall expect general sympathy with their own exertions in return But the majority of mankind are too ignorant selfish or wicked to be touched any of the more generous sympathies It is to them that they every day see interest sacrificed to bad habits bad tempers and evil affections This does not enable them to comprehend how interest can liver be sacrificed to the love of country or of the human race They cannot believe that the better affections of our nature can be so hig hly and constantly cultivated as to become passions which demand gratification in patriotic generous and benevolent acts An attention to these truths and an anticipation of the risks to be encountered by rights may to some suppl consistency of conduct which in the end to them asit
