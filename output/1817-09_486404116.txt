Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)The above remarks apply of books than their style which was rather to the substance meant for the subject of this paper Il is necessary therefore to say few words about verbal style as well as style of conception The great of modern style perhaps is that its beauties like those of polite cant arc growing conventional instead of natural We now find as many set terms peculiar to books as there are sanctioned belonging to conversation Authors uniformly adopt the same model and become infected with one of the most pernicious ever entered into an empty head namely that of establishing certain system of jargon which is to be considered as characteristic of literary good breeding When authors turn gentlemen there is reason to suspect that literature is approaching to its grand consummation There is no need for one gentleman sitting down to state his ideas to another for their ideas will be found all alike that sturdy piece of timber may he considered as the only remaining writer of unsophisticated English and this palladium of liberty and fine has been driven across the Atlantic by certain well-bred people of whose speeches in Parliament it is only necessary to observe the style and the substance may vie with each other as models of what is disgusting In short the conclusion seems to be this that no writer will now be able to express those peculiarities of mind which constitute genius unless he take his position on the basis of professed vulgarity
