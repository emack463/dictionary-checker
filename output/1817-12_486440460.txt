LITERATUREThe Scotsman (1817-1858)LITERATURE DR CIIAUIEIlS AND THE WHIGS delivered ill the Tron Church Glasgow Nov 19 1817 ByTno CnALMEiis Although we are persuaded ourselves that we arc as much neutralized from any design hostile to tlio good of the country ns tlie reverend and worthy doctor -that we could do an act of justice to an individual at the risk of being holdup -that the Whigs as party make an exertion beneficial to the country we could praise them at the risk of being thought mere partisan -nay that Whigs and Tones unite in supporting wrong measure we could arraign the conduct of both at the risk of being jacobins -though persuaded thai we could do all this without being trimmers or partisans or jacobins or any thing but sincere lovers of our countrys wral we nre not yet sure that Dr CHAI MEBS will thank us for praise or admiration Dreading as lie seems to do the idea of being favoured or lauded by the Wliig party we suspect that hia prejudices will make him reject our little tribute to his genius ii-i something noxious or dangerous for if we mistake not the sermon in question lius been published solely for the purpose ot clearing himself from tlie suspicion that he had become an oppositionist in consequence of tlie recent measures or Government Add truly if tlie Whigs were what lie seems to represent tl ein -n set of men nothing but what opponents mnd- and they talk hypocritically of public rights public good then indeed would he have good reason to consider the smallest approach to them as leading to contain But is it not lamentable to see man of -of Christian zeal-of such general usefulness -stooping so low as to adopt and disseminate one of tlie most vulgar unjust prejudices of Ills time nnd country We ure by no means devoted to the Whigs or any other party Bin we would do then and ail parties justice If those wh now brill but place and power we should be forced to below the ordinary run oF mankind Oilier men for attaining ends The Whigs on the contrary adopt Il principles professed by tlie ears of royalty The consequences which result from their what is called tlie Wliig party had no objects in view admit on the rst

principles on the of the people are if possible still less welcome Such professions and such conduct on account of the individuals having professed and taught arc not ingratiating Tlie that will be

of sides is neither matter of indifference nor of principle this to limited power and life ind resist all the future temptations of interest and mere balancing of prospects tlie honest determination
