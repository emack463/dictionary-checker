Front Page 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)MONO the various instances of gross and culpable inattention to the interests of this country displayed by our employed in framing the late treatie with th continental powers seem than their taking no notice whatever of the immense sum due by Austria to-the people of Great Britain on account of the loans made to that power id 1795 and 1797 The deranged situation of the finances of Austria affords no why we should be saddled with her debts Neither are her difficulties in that respect which may be properly termed temporary at all to be compared with our own Her expenditure does not exceed her revenue by 25 or 30 millions nor are her inhabitants sinking under the pressure of an intolerable taxation To talk of Austria being less able than Britain to bear the burden of this debt is not only irrelevant to the subject but is really absurd Unencumbered with redundant population and possessing an immense supply of fertile and hitherto uncultivated land the capabilities of Austria for improvement arc greater than those of any other European power with the exception of Russia She too has been the greatest gainer by the recent contest Her acquisition of the Venetian territories has given her SKI frontier and has opened up market for tlie disposal of the raw produce of Hungary and other extensive provinces bordering on the Adriatic By fact was gainer Her dominions being and compact her forces with greater on any one point spread over an immense extent of countries hut in case well-defined and of the of Carinthia Stiria and her losing the Netherlands Austria in now more will be able to act They are not as formerly disjointed of invasion will have to defend naturally strong frontier Such being tlic case and considering the exertions we had made in expected that she would at tlic conclusion of repaying lie sum due to us And for her at once to repaid the money she boon such as tlie free admission of our guaranteed to her by the acts of the That no such her behalf it was but reasonable to peace taken measures for surely if it had inconvenient could not have objected to tlie granting us some trifling manufactured commodities into the ports of Italy Congress until the debt 11 question had been cancelled of -but that the prohibitory regulations of the Austrian customhouse should instantly have been extended to the Ragusan territory which apparently on account of its being republic our representatives at Congress assisted in making over to Austria -is not so lation was made -that none such was ever much to be ascribed to the injustice of the Austrian as to the stupidity or something worse than stupidity of our own rulers If the former should of their own taken steps to sum EwcY MILLIONS for such according to tlie official statement which we this day publish is the amount of the debt due to us by Austria much more tlie latter considering the exhausted state of our finances and the wei ht of our taxation have insisted on its repayment We had fought the battles of every prince on the continent and had lavishly expended our blood and treasure in their support and certainly when restoring them to their former power and greatness we had just right to insist on their making good their engagements to us In this every thing else the real once thought of by our attended to was the parcelling out of the different German the of France BoIgiunT ta nd however as in almost interests of the people of Britain were never ambassadors-at Vienna The onl thing they States and- the delivering over Spain bound 61 itary stipulation in which they had been so horribly oppressed Such of pure religion for which we hand and foot ar id without one favour of liberty to the old despotism was tlie restoration of social order and had pretended to make and such was followed by the ministers of country calling merit ministers arrogated to themselves for offering of -eat Britain 700 000 enabling them successfully to the times Now if pittance like ihe conduct in regard to forei gn nations itself free Our readers will an extraordinary last winter to lend the agriculturists and manufacturers at 5 per cent interest by way contend with tlie difficulties of this -Mf the squeezing money out of our pockets with llie 5 per cent with the other be could have done any good one hand and lending us the same money at for national suffering and distress what must have been our situation bonus without being to pay one farthing tin would in tlie present state of the been employed in supporting would yielded an annual constituted fund for very considerable number of workmen expended as revenue as had we received TWENTY MILLIONS Sterling as of interest And really sum like country have been of incalculable service Had it productive labour revenue of one or two millions and would have sufficient to afford permanent Or supposing it to have been it is equal to llie whole sum levied in Scotland as taxes during tlie years its payment would Iiave dispense with our for the ensuing five or if they proper to dispose of it in way it would have England nnd Wales from tlic couple of years to come When is have made to tlic people of Austrio them chatter about their loans of couple ministers to contributions had not thought sufficed to deliver the landlords and armors of intolerable burden of poor rates for lie fact when such is the gratuitous boon our ministers -it is reall sickening to hear of millions at 5 per cent and their other ridiculous schemes for they ofo distresses and hardships are pleased to call an alleviation But it seems that panacea is still in reserve far honest JOHN BULL He is not to bo sure ever to finger one sixpence of tlie money but then the forests of Dalmatia are at his service He is to get as much wood in lieu of the cash as will build all bft wooden walls for twenty or fifty years to come at least such is the story which the Treasury writers have lately trumped up to JOHN inexpressible satisfaction We confess however that we are not without our doubts that this will only serve to add another to lie innumerable hoaxes with which poor Mr BULL has during the last twenty years been duped and deceived It is stated indeed Mr SMITH who had been sent to Trieste to examine tlie timber has already contracted for 300 000 loads but the terms of this contract have not been made public and we should not be at all surprised if fresh loan shall be found necessary to liquidate the transaction But supposing the price of tlie Dalmatian timber is to be deducted from the sum due us by Austria its importation will not in our opinion be of the least benefit to us It has not been affirmed that the timber in question is in any degree to that which can be purchased in tlie Baltic but on the contrary from the reports of those who have visited the Venetian arsenals there seems good reason for believing decidedly inferior quality We al of materials which had not been subjected to any timber have become useless in the course of those built of our advantage its exportation had of tlic loan it to be of ady suffered -from building ships proper examination Many of those constructed of Canada of seasons and if such should be the case willi Austrian timber it would bo for been prohibited and that we had still wanted payment Sucli would bo our view of ibis transaction tlie same But gullible as JOHN BULL were frei ghts ftom Memel and Trieste is he will we apprehend at once perceive tlie absurdity of the that the excess of thi England oves tnt of one from latter And therefore as the Morning allies were to make present wood dea bargain whole scheme when he is told of cargo of timber from Trieste to Mcmel is greater than its prime cost the Chronicle has justly observed though our it would prove An extremely To enlarge farther on tin but we may be permitted ways look witli an extremely would be to observe
