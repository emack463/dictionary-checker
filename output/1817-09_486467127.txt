REFLECTIONS OF A WEEKThe Scotsman (1817-1858)REFLECTIONS OF WEEK It is too often forgotten even by honest men of public trust to acquiesce in crimes is in all its practical effects he same as to partake of them and that tenderness to individual delinquents is injustice to the community REVIEW THE duty which we must necessarily perform of toiling through the literature and the news of each succeeding day is the source of many serious reflections But none is more than this which is pressed upon us from thousand quarters that in this country the French Revolution has produced -we had almost said determination in all holders of office from the overseers of parish work-house to the most dignified functionaries of the State -to support all sorts of abuse in all circumstances and in all situations If there be any truth in theology or history there is corrupt tendency in human nature which to preserve official persons in the line of duty requires every stimulus which can be given watchful inspection and every counteracting regulation which can be formed and reduced to practice There is nothing more dangerous or demoralizing therefore than the habit of associating loyally with tolerance of every species of mismanagement and peculation It presents tlie bad with art impenetrable shield and casts such mist round the eyes of the class in this country -that they see sphere of their own immediate observation Such men are belief that all which is would-do-well characters -a very numerous is doing within what ought to be the easily flattered their pride are both gratified their inferiors always bring against those wlio would put them man now desire to correct an abuse whether hospital or police establishment the them is well Their indolence and by the charges of restlessness and vanity to the trouble of making investigations If any it occur in public knaves wlio are interested in its continuance arc sure to raise the cry in the belief enlist on their powerful

to have been that great deal too much was left in the power of Mr HASLAM apothecary to the institution This person gave much evasive testimony to shift from himself the burden of most atrocious case which though of fourteen years standing does not seem to have been known to the governors One keeper in this hospital was notorious drunkard surgeon was generally insane and drunk No wonder that deaths were accelerated and scenes exhibited which will ever be disgrace to humanity and to that metropolis in the centre of which they existed Yet select committee of the governors of this institution after Mr EDWARD private gentleman prompted only by benevolent feelings had discovered many of the abuses afterwards fully proved before the Parliamentary Committee -reported that there was
