Editorial Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)Since our Leading Article of to-day was put to press we have learned with very great satisfaction requisition signed by lc most respectable Burgc-scs is about to be presented to tlie Dean oTT Guild requesting him to convene NEI AI MliETlNCr OF THI BuROEShES AND GuiLD-BRI -TlinEN TO TAKE THE IMPUmANT Or BURGH RErullM INTO TIIE 1 CONSlUUEATION Our readers will find some farther particulars respecting the melancholy and much lamented death of the Princess CHARLOTTE in our paper of to-day under tlie London We give our cordial assent to the observations made by tlie Morning Chronicle on the cry which has been set up for an investigation into all the particulars connected with this fatal accouchement Such proceeding could be of no service The blow is as irreparable as it is overwhelming But we believe that every thing which human skill and art could possibly devise was done to ward it oft And we shall most sincerely lament if either the writings or SPEECHES of medical men different and erroneous impression shall be made on the public mind Ot course these observations have no reference to the conduct of the relatives of the Princess respecting which we presume to give no opinion To us indeed it appears quite unaccountable in her most interesting and delicate situation the Princess CHARLOTTE the presumptive heir to the Britisli Throne -should not have had either the soothing and assistance of her grandmother her mother alas could not be there or any one of her six aunts and that she should not even have been attended during her pregnancy by single married lady All this we think is extraordinary But for aught we know however revolting to our and vulgar notions of propriety and decorum tlie absence of every one of the nearest relatives on such an occasion maybe quite consistent ith court etiquette already on more than one occasion observed how Germany liad contributed towards the spread of the many advantages derived to small principality any celebrity their rights and liberties the inferior potentates The students were not amenable to any other distinction of talents could

universities of that country arc not as they arc almost slavery -they arc not leagued with the cause of despotism -Science is not there prostituted to the ba of all purposes -to tlie framing excuses

sovereign of his age we have no hesitation in asserting But his love of genuine liberty his unwearied zeal for the improvement of science and for thing which can conduce to the happiness and comfort
