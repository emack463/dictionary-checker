Front Page 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)XT is alwa difficult to make the -public see the real of subject which weals an abstract appearance and on which some reflection is necessary they can perceive how it affects their individual interests If-a new tat be proposed on leather on salt or on income it is easy to put the whole nation in hubbub classes privileged and unprivileged the people atlarge will in such case meet petition and remonstrate but though defect ill the existing laws were pointed out or new law proposed which from its consequences to personal security should be

security at all Much evil may be done and without the agent being aware of impure motives but the functionary there is no much partiality displayed however impure or unjust his intentions may hove been he will not become never be established against him We tremble at the courts of law to purge an official person from his proceedings that he the accused or his own accuser nor acknowledge wrong which can idea its being held sufficient in all suspicion and to prove the fairness of or suspected party declares that he was actuated no impure purgation that might Nay our RICH our REYNOLDSES and establishing their own Thisis of be undergone by the worst inquisitor our OLIVERS would in this way find ho in innocence These and many similar reflections have an account of the proceedings on Bench and on contemplating respecting the nomination of special juries it is impossible our minds by perusing recent to the Court of King the state of the law in England not to advert to tlie state tif our own law the naming of assizes in all criminal trials The is somewhat abstract certainly but itis of paramount importance It involves the property character liberty and life of every man the country In England there is no complaint respecting the manner in which lories are named but in appointing special pries would appear that functionary in the Crown Office named of course by the King Ministers may exercise species of discretion The manner of doing tins it is true is fixed by practice and the agent ofthe accused party is entitled to attend while the full assize is selected But in Scotland if we understand the matter rightly we are even without these securities We know nothing of the manner in which the ist of those who are thought qualified to serve on juries-is made up nor do we-know any thing as to the principles on which the panel of-jurors sent into court is taken from the list The Sheriffa-depute of counties or She Sheriff-substitutes clerks or assistant clerks -up the lists and return the names of 45 Jurors in each case to the Justiciary Court And so far as this maybe done from-principle prejudice whim or evil intention according 1 to the character and temper of the functionary for the time We never heard for instance -that an agent-f ShCiiO for the when the list of jurors-on any particular trial to the Criminnl Court But it is First for making up the list of naming the panel of jurymen in and so fully known to the accused they shall have it in prisoner could inquire what county of Edinburgli pr insist on being was to be made up or selected and returned quite obvious that if there be no fixed rule persons and secondly for each particular case parties as that their power by their agents to see the rule in impartially observed we have no security for obtaining justice both cases strictly and -none Justice may hitherto it may be done again but the security the breast of one functionary whether injustice is to be with to Judges with were anxious to lodge the -sole of the law from the been done is totally wanting It is in be justice or administered- And as Earl STANHOPE remarked whom party in the State application as well as determination that you put it in tlie power of certain functionaries to return men of certain sentiments to cases you make it the arise to appoint for such functionaries his to support government decide as jurymen on interest of any corrupt Minister who eh ill hereafter most violent partisans and those who would go the greatest lengths During signified little how Juries were There was little wealth public spirit in Scotland But our considerable our habits of industry and enterprise more We is public in Scotland now which is sensible of the period of our former it scanty population no and consequently no is now of some consequence our is property and character anil liberties to guard and defend There of public rights md and which these can be We have national press which desires to be snd thus TRIAL BY JURY with all that as much importance theNorth aa in the South maintained only by public fret- ns well as that ofEngland to-it is become of nearly We have now much to lose -and should therefore inquire how it is to be protected For these reasons then -we would caH thQ attention of the people of Scotland and more particularly the existing Parliamentary Commissioners for inquiring into the state of the Justiciary Court to the mariner in which Juries are at present appointed for as we Kavc remarked elsewhere the boasted trial by Jury is worse than hoax if the jurymen be not impartially nominated And our argument is that wherever there is any discretion there-can be no security Suppose or moment that set of bad with the design of crushing all freedom of discussion should resolve on attempting to sedition what is nothing more than fair and constitutional examination and reprobation of their own treasonous measures could any tiling contribute more powerfully to the success of their mischievous desi gns than- their being able to appoint -functionaries who again have the power of naming jurors at their own discretion There is not county in Scotland in which forty-five tools might not be selected devoted to any purposes of any ministry Nay there arc many individuals who without being wicked are yet so ignorant as to consider all discussion of public measures is improper and for the most part seditious and to hold lir an reason common pi as species pf common parlance called sober decent possibly exist even in these times who violence to their consciences to be ormed from the were to happen no one of tlie smallest penetration can political offence would be found guilty while against treason Now these are generally and in men and official persons may would not feel that they had done great selecting Jury or Panel from which Jury is class of men just mentioned But if such thing hesitate about the consequences Every person accused of although animated only by the purest flame of and line of their duty and went stop beyond their result in so far as it depended on the Jury With forming constellation of genius and educated in an liberal views from the Dnr an
