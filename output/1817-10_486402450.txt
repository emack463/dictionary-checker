ON THE FREEDOM OF TRADEThe Scotsman (1817-1858)ON THE FREEDOM OF TRADE TJne prohibition force les capitaux et Iindustrie qu on aurait ce genre de production appliquer une production moins SAr Cateckisme THE Treasury Journals would have us to believe that commerce is reviving in every part of the Empire and that it will soon be as flourishing as ever But our readers wili we presume place very little reliance on their exaggerated statements That partial revival of trade has indeed taken place we have no doubt and as it furnishes striking confirmation of the correctness of the princip les we advanced in former paper On the freedom of Trade we shall again beg to call the attention of our readers to this most important subject The decay of our trade as we then endeavoured to shew has been almost entirely owing to our own ridiculous policy We will not buy consequently foreigners cannot buy from us is nothing but an interchange of to accept the commodities of any it is evident we can refused for example to take the raw cotton and be able to furnish an equivalent is it not obvious that if we purchase en from foreigners and Commerce it must be recollected commodities If therefore we refuse particular nation in exchange for our own manufactures carry on no direct intercourse with it If we other produce of America how would the Americans for the commodities they now purchase from us And times more American produce than we do at present the Americans would either have to purchase ten their own gratis limes more of our goods or to give us These princi and obvious that it should ever have been lost notwithstanding their having been conviction of every has at all considered notions about the ples appear so exceedingly is somewhat surprising they sight of by legislators But long since established to the unprejudiced person who the subject the old balance of trade have still considerable influence We are still taught to look the exports over the imports as and to this failing we must in great have at various times been imposed on the introduction the excess of the only criterion of an advantageous traffic measure ascribe the extraordinary solicitude for continuing the innumerable restrictions which of foreign commodities however of estimating the profits of external trade it is decidedly absurd in our home market of greater value than those we exported carry on no commerce at This method is not merely inaccurate but If the goods we import were not when sold it is clear we could all No merchant would ever send broad 10 000 worth of cottons designed importing in lieu value by sum equal to cover all unless the goods he thereof exceeded this the expenses and to yield of stock on tlic capital manner and to export greater value than to send his capital to therefore is in spite of all amount of the imports exceeds the exports tlie greater the common and ordinary employed To suppose him to act in an opposite he imported would be to suppose him The truth that has been said on the subject thai the more the is the real gain to the country and hence whatever obstacles are in the way of importing must at any time placed be hostile to our best interests Assuredly no country in the world has so rapidly accumulated capital as the United States have done since the revolutionary war and yet this famous balance about which our politicians give themselves so much unnecessary trouble has been constantly against them The Americans always imported more than they exported they have always to use the phraseology of our practical men had an unfavourable balance of payments and consequently drain upon them for cash and still notwithstanding all these untoward circumstances they have realised immense sums by intercourse with foreigners It is somewhat curious that with this fact staring us in the face we should still be concocting Tresh restrictions on importation But it is said that tlie excess of exports over imports as indicated by the Customhouse is always cancelled by of specie This statement however will not explain the matter With the exception of the United States there is no country in the world which lias not its favourable balance and the entire produce of the mines though it were increased ten fold would be insufficient for their payment Bill lion too like every other commodity naturally seeks the market where its exchangeable value is greatest and cannot be forced into any other Although the balance of trade were thousand millions in our fa vour we should hot on that account be able to import one sixpence of bullion if it would bring better price in any other country And what is of equal consequence though the balance were as much hero than in the oilier states having an intercourse as the equilibrium of value had been restored The specie will ever depend on on nothing else Who would export hats to 20 if they could as for 25 or 30 And what country would send it to greater advantage elsewhere against us still if the real value of bullion was greater it would be poured in upon us till such time or efflux of the state of the market -and country where they would only sell easily be sent to one where they would sell gold to Britain if it could-dispose of The idea therefore that the excess of exports over imports is constantly paid in bullion is the case there ought to be present from two to of the precious metals that has ever been sent abroad being paid in bullion to be commerce would not therefore be more advantageous than if corn wine flax or any altogether If such were really in this country at three hundred millions after deducting all Government But admitting this statement of the balances perfectly they were paid with other commodity The supply of consumable articles is very often deficient in country but with bullion If the quantity of specie were diminished sixpence almost no inconvenience but half bushel of wheat could not that can scarcely ever be the case could be made to perform the office of shilling with afford the an idle and ridiculous prejudice which would make us import gold What merchant intellect of person than rum if the profit to be ide by the other And what ouchi we to think bullion though nutriment of whole bushel It is and silver in preference to any oilier wlio should advise him to import bullion from Jamaica tlie hitter was greater what could be realised wisdom of government who attempts to force the importation of less valuable here than some other produce by prohibiting the introduction of the latter The grand argument however in favour of the restrictive system rests on the assumption that the internal trade of country is more advantageous than its external trade This opinion which is extremely plausible in itself has been countenanced by very high authority Dr SMITH has observed that tlie capital which sends Scots manufactures to London and brings back En glish corn and manufactures to Edinburgh replaces by every such operation two British capitals which had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of Great Britain The capital employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption when this purchase is made with tlie produce of domestic industry replaces too by every such operation two distinct capitals but one of them onl is employed in supporting domestic industry Tlie capital which sends British goods to Portugal and brings back Great Britain replaces capital the other is Portuguese one consumption should be as great as tlie home will give but one-half the Portuguese goods to by every operation only one Britisli the returns therefore of the foreign trade of trade tlie capital employed-in it encouragement to the industry or productive labour of the country This conclusion is however Dr SMITH has shewn must always be in direct employs in erroneous The industry of country as proportion to the amount of capital which it producing and unless it can be established that tlie purchasing of foreign commodities has here alluded to will not follow Althou -Ii tile except which could be produced at less quantity of corn silk capital employed in agriculture and in would export pro port greater quantity increase our tendency to force capital abroad the consequence restrictive system were tills instant abolished no commodities would be imported expense elsewhere We should import much greater than at present and of course part of the llie silk would then be disengaged but we of some other produce By increasing our imports we exports to precisely lie to the carrying on of same extent This is condition essential commerce and without which it cannot exist Of course the of capital would still be to import and employed too let it be be carried on It
