Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)by tlie fact they saw religion disfigured by impostures and degraded into an engine of state policy The very facility with which tlie revolution was

clearing the atmosphere of unhealthy vapours and sowing tlie seeds of future improvement But one of the most remarkable effects of BONAPARTE conquests was that the military force of the continental princes being broken or destroyed they were forced at last reluctantly to stay themselves on the national spirit of subjects Tlie hatred of foreign yoke so common in all roused the people from the apathy which their domestic tyranny had generated and the resources of popular enthusiasm were again found to be tible It was in reality by this force that BONAPARTES efforts to retrieve his affairs after the disastrous campaign of 1812 were defeated The spirit of his government had extinguished popular enthusiasm in trance while his oppressive conquests had raised it up in other countries and he was ruined as he himself is said to have acknowledged by the grand error of arming the public of Europe against himself It was quite natural that the people after repairing the neglect and mismanagement of their rulers by their voluntary efforts should feel their importance and demand some security against such evils in future affairs In the hour of difficulty arid danger promises the-possession of an efficient control over their own to this effect were given But how have they been kept All that has been done -by the boasted liberators of his pen his they have sacrificed the
