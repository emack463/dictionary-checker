actually done we must add the good that is prevented Public offices as public honours ought to be bestowed upon men who have gained the confidence of their fellow-citizens either by rendering valuable services to the community or by giving proofs of public spirit and ability which shew that such services might be expected from them But such men are repelled by the very aspect of the system or if they arc sometimes drawn in by their own ambition or the importunities of their friends to accept of office they generally retire in very short time disgusted by the cupidity and selfishness of the creatures with whom they are associated The consequence of this is that the offices of magistracy fall into the hands of persons of two classes the one of which is bent entirely upon serving themselves and the other-is incapable of serving the public The first consists of low political adventurers tools of any administration because they les of any party seeking jobs or places The other
