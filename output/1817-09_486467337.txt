Front Page 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)THERE are honest men who can hardly be brought to ee the necessity of watching power and the knaves ind impostors who Iiave always made gain of loyalty Ktiformly preach up confidence in those from whom hey derive profit and advantage It has occurred to is therefore that some honest scruples may be and some sound principles strengthened by few retrospective glances at the history of our Government The Wise Man has told us that there is new under the sun it st et est idem fief And this maxim is of application If statesmen therefore have who were quite willing to barter tlie honour md liberties of their country for power and profit we nay rely upon it that such men may appear again Sven in our own time as BURKE remarked in his we iee no particular sanctity that is at all likely by to overrule the course of Perhaps the most extraordinary instance of depravity in public men is presented to us in the reign of he Second Charles That misguided and profligate Prince threw himself into the arms of cabal of able iit desperate men who in despite of the warning still ing mg in his ears from the unhappy fate of his father him to HUME tells us that he eader of relying on the con- had surmounted all sense of shame and most criminal Another of the take courses of the most ional and tyrannical nature these unprincipled ministers

nineteenth is little else than copy of able and willing if grained in his ambition to usurping subjects Thus we see the claim to of expression The cant of that of the seventeenth century Ilic common cause of kings thus to be the ower of superseding Parliament But that could not well be persevered United States of Holland were then view-0 id with Vmcrica now are by the continental legitimates by solemn treaty by the defended in Sharks was nil law and def ying in while there was one Jrcc government The the same jealousy as the United States of harles it is true was bound merest and honour of England to support tlie Dutch That war undertaken against Holland by the united force of two such mighty potentates as himself and Lours would prove an easy enterprise that under pretence of that war he would obtain great against tlie aggressions of France But then he was supplies from the Commons and in subsidies from France and could levy such military force as would enable him to recover the prerogatives of ths Crown and that subduing the States great step would be made towards reformation of the government since it was apparent that that republic by its fame and grandeur fortified in his factious subjects their attachment to they termed their civil and reli ious liberties Exactl in this manner do our ministerial prints speak of the glorious cause in-which the Patriots of South America arc now engaged and so with little variation do they speak of those patriots at home who desire to maintain the constitution who deprecate revolution and who would ive security at once to tlic prince and the people The suggestions we have just quoted says HU-ME happened to concur witli of the king In desire of Catholic religion his avidity beginning of his to have and rm that account desire of ying France Several of these propensities and prejudices are ever enjoyed liberty they must luhm encouraged ultimately as all the and prejudices more extensive authority his propensity to the for money He seems likewise from the very entertained great jealousy of his own subjects himself by an intimate alliance natural to all princes and in countries which have bad ministers prove fatal as they did in the cases of Charles First and James Second the former andthe latter his crown The minister who his prince jealousy of his the throne and the advises hateful measures-for exciting acts his own slanders and shape who cannot be up to too much execration Yet of whom lost his head implants in the breast of subjects is an enemy equally to people but he the purpose of fanning the flame of discord and of outrage to make good his own power is fiend in human monsters have existed at various times and in different countries And tlie thing that is no new thing under tlie sun hath been it is which shall be there The truth of this by every portion of Charles reign The Parliament the Hollanders were tlie common enemies of all accusation conditions of peace were exacted from them moral is pressed upon us of the history Chancellor of England told the monarchies And to give countenance to tin which no people could possibly comply with Amonsr was demanded by tlie Britisli Ministers Tliat seditious libels on others it all persons guilty of treason against the king or of complaint be banished from the dominions of the Stales We do not mention tin the same spirit which now interferes witli tlie exemplified in other tyrannical princes HUME tells us the presence of lie Dutch ambassadors excited tlie sentiments of tender indignation amon the among those who foresee the aim ami result in Europe tlie one by land tlie so much from its being degrading condition as to show press of Switzerland and Belgium lias however that notwithstanding the rigorous conduct of the Court compassion and even people in general especially of these dangerous counsels The two most powerful monarchs oilier sea have contrary to the faith of solemn treaties combined to exterminate an illustrious republic What dismal prospect does success afford to tlie nei of the one and the subjects of the other During the entire submission of the nation and dutiful behaviour of the Parliament dangerous projects without provocation are formed to reduce them to subjection and all the foreign interests of the people arc sacrificed in order the more surel to bereave them of then domestic liberties Lest any instance of freedom should remain within their view the United Provinces the real barrier of England must be abandoned to the most dangerous enemy of England and an universal combination of tyranny against laws and liberty all mankind uho have retained in any degree their precious though hitherto precarious ghts are for ever to submit to slavery and injustice Tlie nation being at length roused by these sentiments defeated the conspiracy of tlie King and his Ministers against the people Tlie Crown was compelled to make peace with Holland and tlie project for annihilating liberty in country met with that fate we trust it is also fated to encounter in South America It does not appear however the plan for changing the religion and thi constitution of England was ever abandoned tlie King and by pursuing it with less disguise his his accession reduced to the necessity of abdicating The dangerous designs historian arc to be collected by of their more secret councils but so blinded was James with temper that even contain expressions which condemnation brother tlie Duke of York was not long after of oilier Princes says In lenient comparison 01 their several actions or discovery zeal so transported his imperious his proclamations and public edicts without farther inquiry may suffice to Ills We have no desire at present to England in Ireland DALZIEL bring forward to observation the blood cruelties in and in Scotland tools every way worthy of tlie Princes employed Neither blood-thirsty nor the of were seldom at loss for the worst machinations of the Court On topics to peruse tlie two last volumes of HUME History which and apologises for more will yet be sufficient to lovo of regulated freedom What we shall we remark on the conduct of the tlie Judges in general who for two some precedent or princi ple 01 device to support we shall content ourselves witli recommending to our readers lie perhaps suppresses mud excite 111 their minds hatred of tyranny and already cherishing constitutional jealousy of our ministers jealousy which done should afford some reasons for we hope to strengthen by taking in future number some additional glances at tlie more recent history tlie remarks of HUME on the extraordinary attempt made condemnation of fur hi gh tni other men so odious and notorious for want of princi is sufficiently scandalous says this historian attended to but there is some reason to think himself of Ireland But we conclude tin hy quoting in the reign of diaries Second to procure tlie -ou on tlie evidence of Tiinni LE SMITH and le no jury
