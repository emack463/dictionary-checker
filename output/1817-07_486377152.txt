TREATMENT OF PRISONERS UNDER THE SUSPENSION LAWThe Scotsman (1817-1858)TREATMENT OF PRISONERS UNDER THE SUSPENSION LAW Thew id raga what have suffered 1 1 tros -insulted -left to languish In dungeon butI bore it cheerily My heart was glad -for have done my duty pitied my and Iwrrswd Fur Vie poor men tf England Southty Wat Tslw have chosen this subject chiefly because it has been treated with levity by some Members of Parliament who have been unable to see any difference between persons confined under the suspension law and those wlio have been committed in order to lie tried for murder robbery theft and other Felonies To our minds it displays no small degree of ignorance to state or even imagine the cases to be at all similar With respect to crimes not the ordinary forms of procedure are not departed from No one is detained in prison on tM ic 0 of having committed theft or robbery In uch case tlie law is put in motion after the fact and in the grand jury must find true bill of indictment The trial too is proceeded in forthwith and there is 110 delay of ice But in all these respects how different is the case of ene imprisoned under the suspension act of the suspension the Hat ea Corpus Their proceedings are thus taken in many instances before the fact Tlic protection derived in other cases from tlie verdict of any longer the of forcing on trial Not onl deprived even of the means of ultimately obtaining justice of all punishments of In tho irst place the law si Act empowers Ministers to imprison on suspicion and consequently without any evidence of guilt grand jury not allowed here nor lias the imprisoned party is tlie preliminary security withheld but he is He is by solitary confinement the most severe death before trial and without trial from the bosom of numerous and helpless this punishment may be indefinitely protracted He may have been torn family who die for want during his confinement His fortune health may all have been sacrificed of Meddling fool of neighbour is more to the malignity of every one imprisoned under the suspension law is as murderer or treated exactly as thief to suspicion-to the suspicion whose political prejudices arc different from Ins own or of government spy And as this may be tlie cnse every one in such situation to be ironed there is no ambiguity There is no danger in guilt In proceeding against such criminals lie yields only But with regard to supposed political offences there is In the guilt of murderer robber or thief nny case of mistaking innocence for to call of the public for public security donger that mistakes most serious nature mny JC committed If patient thinking imd reasoning be formed and correct notions of political speaking greater in forming political sentiments than
