had to lay before the public ha made thorn escape your memory and considering them closely connected with the subject of- reform have taken the liberty to remind you arid at the same time to lay before you afew For considerable time when billets were issued in this town to the militia an allowance of Is 6 per week-was made for each billet to the on wham the soldiers were quartered but for some tinic past this allowance lias been withdrawn and the present practice is to give every two soldiers billet for month at a- lime on- one of tile inhabitants who in obliged to quarter triem either in hiSown ftir that period or him about 2 per to find room ibr them elsewhere which costs week The staff stationed here is tlie Colonel whose mansion is in the neighbourhood sent to himselF the paymaster the quarter-master the and drummers It is to these last the to some kind of employment many of abd having no military duty to take up tht-ir of them have been informed carry on their work in that of the disembodied Edinburgh militia consisting of and who have een has refused billets when adjutant the surgeon and about sixty corporals billets are granted All of them have them have families in the town time the occupations they have been Some Musselburgh and Edinburgh and reside while at tlie same tithe they contrive to run billets oil the inhabitants said that the number who receive billets are about sixty and in Dalkcith and to pocket the money have two of being coupled about thirty billets per week which at 3 or annum This sum Only on few individuals bear it Without insinuating that there is any partiality on tlie that some of tlie receive Billets much than others for month at time This inequality in -proper motives on the port billet-master in one billet make room is no less than 156 per who probably it is thought are best able to part of the billet-master there is no doubt and it will- be-remembered the the billets may proceed from very but surdy billet-master is not person to be entrusted with such discretionary power where no allowance is made know and as little power to control his measures Besides the are the most suitable persons to be saddled with and to and the more especially as the inhabitants nave ho access to most upright mind may greatly mistake who bear this burden be no way surprising that number of the Parliament and conceiving the law to be on their side was left to the men and tlie inhabitants to settle as order was issued from head-quarters for the men ingly against the will of the inhabitants 1 From this view of the case it will inhabitants becoming dissatisfied began to examine the act of resolved to refuse the billets For about six weeks the matter they pleased but these few day an to make their quarters good which has done
