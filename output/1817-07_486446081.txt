destroying all was valuable and honourable and dignified in our institutions hear Of those systematic endeavours had not been more illustrious proof during the whole Session than was exhibit ed by the Honourable and Learned Gentleman that day Tlie Honourable and Learned Member began by stating Parliament instead of relieving tlie distresses of the country had commenced by depriving tlie people of their liberties He de nicd the assumption of the Honourable and Learned Gentleman and maintained Parliament had used all due diligence anil devoted themselves witli as great degree of practical effect

at lie increase of tlie general property countenance he gave his speeches in House to of doors wns calculated to produce very different consequences The Honournblu disavowed he aimed at the subversion of the Constitution its protection and its improvement Witli respect to what Parliament Iiad at its present state and the condition it was in when honest nnd good men fell confidence and security They of the country as displayed by tlie rise in the funds from 62 to 80 and lie should always prevented tlie success of persons who sought either But the Honourable and Learned Gentleman lias asserted
