Front Page 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)TM Number we glanced at thehistory arid progress of the late war in the- course of which we ascribed the lessened consequence of the Whigs and the growing dissatisfaction of the People to the enormous patronage and undermining influence of the Crown This opinion is by no novel for so far back as the 7 th of May 1783 that heaven-born Minister Mr PITT stated in the House of Commons that of the existence of radical error no one seem- ed to doubt nay he said almost all were so clearly satisfied of it that various remedies had been devised by those who wished most heartily to remove it The House itself had discovered that secret influence of the Crown was sapping the very foundation of liberty by corruption the influence of the Crown hadbeen felt within those walls mil had often been found strong enough to stifle 1 ic sense of duty and to overrule the propositions made to satisfy the wishes and- desires of the people the House of Commons in former Parliaments had been base enough to feed the influence that enslaved-its-members and thus was at one tinie the parent and the offspring of corruption This influence however had risen to such height that men were ashamed any longer to deny its existence and the House had at length been driven to the necessity of voting that it ought to be diminished Various were the expedients that had been thought of in order to effect so salutary purpose as was that of guarding against influence of shutting against it the doors of that House where if it once got footing after the resolution alluded to liberty could no longer find an spirit ef the Constitution should be the and control over the executive power would through this oppression to destroy the Constitution in effect though The House of Commons which according to the true guardian of the people freedom the constitutional check influence degenerate into mere engine tyranny it should in its outward form still remain is evidence which will hardly be questioned that INFLUENCE too is evidence that Mr PITT well knew what the House likely to make it How far his politics were to determine But we have no hesitation in asserting that under Herethen was dangerously effective thirty-three yeart ago Here of Commons ought to be and what influence was after he got into power we shall leave for others his administration the influence of the Crown was greatly extended and that if there was an admitted radical error in 1817 The House of Commons as Mr PITT told us rights But for some years past it 178 7 it is much increased in magnitude in ought to be the guardian of the people seems to have been chiefly guarding the prerogatives or increasing the patro nage of the Crown with the people who are listened to only

both cases how we confound those who are duped with the miscreants who dupe them The mass of men are honest in all parties Most of the misled and some even of the aders are well intentioned The people are often at fault and take strong impressions but as we have often urged is this not accounted for if not justified the illiberality and want of candour on the part of tlie privileged who obstinately defend errors which are too palpable to be covered and too obvious in their consequences to be misunderstood The Whigs have been often at fault but do not the short-sighted violences of tlie people afford some apology though not tification There is more true courage ta be displayed in calmly and deliberately considering and stating grievances than in committing outrages which always strengthen the hands of the people enemies Tlie courage of thinking and of constitutionally expressing their thoughts is all that is wanted on the part of the people If they were to adopt plan and act upon it peaceably and consistently they would soon obtain all which they ought to obtain from Parliament But what they have hitherto done lias often liad tlie appearance rather of factious remonstrances
