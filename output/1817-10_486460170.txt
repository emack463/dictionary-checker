BURGH REFORMThe Scotsman (1817-1858)BURGH REFORM In our next publication we shall probably enter at some length into the subject of Edin burgh Burgh Reform work which our readers will observe from the proceedings of the Merchant Company is alread happily begun and which must ultimately succeed whatever become of this first attempt to accomplish it That beginning has been made at the head-quarters

and what is more remarkable still precedent is on the side of the independent Burgesses But still let them not look for an immediate or easy victory Reason and justice and precedent are no match for interest and Iiabit and address aided as they commonly are by cunning and corruption The former therefore must look out for auxiliaries which exist in sufficient abundance among the body of the

will be more extended also though not so productive to one or two individuals and the common good or the revenue of the Burgh will be more carefully administered On the most selfish princi ple therefore it is for tlie interest of the Burgesses that elections should be more open and the right of voting enlarged Custom instead of being lost would be gained and the business of the town and of
