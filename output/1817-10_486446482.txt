Editorial Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)The biennial as well as annual changes in the Mag fEn iS Buh GH have just taken place and air though the public can feel little interest in these events as they have no concern in the appointment yet the comfort of the citizens is in some degree implicated in the character and disposition of the leading Magistrates Of the political sentiments of any person who can here attain to civic honours it is impossible we can speak with approbation but candour requires us to state in those who have retired ministerial systems were not for the present the burgh and exhibited acted as Chief Magistrate for the of increasing the respect in his accessibility His manners were conciliating and their rank found the Lord Provost always ready handsomest manner any in their most offensive aspects Hie Gentleman wlio last two years had the valuable which he was held by all the citizens whatever mi ght be political opinions to do in the official act which mig ht be necessary Those who ever experienced difficulty getting these duties which the inhabitants of and mt with hauteur in properly will be able to the comfort large city derive from of-disposition in their Magistrates We during the last two years in improving and ornamenting the city and directed this activity has on tlie whole been creditable to tlic general and the Loan of Guild in urbanity of manners and an ess may remark too that much activity has been displayed though it may sometimes have been Magistrates in particular as well as beneficial to tlic community Our meed of praise such as it is shall account of any difference in political sentiments be withheld when we think it due on announcing to our readers an an era in the Burgh system of the rince Regent to tlie Burgh of MONTROSE is vested in the inhabitant burgesses and members of the of which is not to be measured by but its ul- It is not easy to express the satisfaction we feel in event which will form Scotland -a new Constitution granted by by which the election of the Magistrates incorporated trades at large This is an the im its immediate which arc of little moment tenor consequences which we trust will be great and not far distant To the inhabitants of Montrose indeed tlic change amounts to little They have elected their own Magistrates for years past but this privilege which they onl by the courtesy of those in office is now established and secured to them and forms the just reward of their exertions and independent spirit It is impossible to ive too much praise to all the parties concerned -to the Magistrates whose liberality led them to identif themselves witli their fellow-citizens and second their efforts in such laudable design or to the People for feeling the influence of those high principles of which their nei afforded them no example of acting on them attained and of this praise we Ministers come in for share as who we presume was more sanction to the new set of the burgh landmark and guide to others over ancient -in the very hot-bed of every tiling base servile till their object was are willing to admit that his Majesty well as the LORD ADVOCATE instrumental in getting the Prince-Regent The conduct of the people of Montrbse is ying the triumph of liberal opinions prejudices and abuses and corrupt -a Scottish burgh The happy result of their efforts is not burghs in the victory gained for themselves but for all the kingdom and indeed for They Iiave set an example alarm -Or apprehension proceeding quietly but most inauspicious and under circumstances this throws new and pleasing It shews that crushed and debased as tlie of our political institutions there is yet an opening all who cherish the love of freedom of reform stript of every thing that can excite and succeeding in its object at lime the the-most unfavourable It is impossible not to feel that light on the situation and prospects of our country of our countrymen has been by the nature improvement without violence them to avail itself of any and disorder and there is yet virtue enough in favourable After what has been achieved at Montrose it will now the inhabitants of bur ghs if they acquiesce in abuses An impulse we hope has been gradually purge our system of its of public opinion and the increased opportunity for ameliorating their condition be reproach to the other which it ISih their power to remedy given to the spirit of temperate reform vices and bring up our institutions to the level degree of ublic intelli gence What has been granted to the inhabitants of Montrose cannot be refused to been more mismanaged and whose disregarded by magisterial and corporation the reasonable petitions of others whose affairs have interests have been more juntos And how much room is there for reform direction There are upwards of sixty burghs in truly said there is any other security for honest and of public concerns than what private virtue of individuals wlio are under situation hol ds out perpetual temptations to political in this Scotland in none of which can it be fair conduct in the management is afforded by the no responsibility to -those for whom they act and whose Could we forward to the of this abuse -it is not easy to calculate how jealousies -to quash low and selfish principle and to spirit eventually suffer no evil to system much would be done to allay and -to raise the standard of public that would exist in any branch of our political ABERDEEN the bankruptcy of which has presented of being useful is likely to be made manly appeal to successors in our earlier columns and it is not expected that the the public spirited with an opportunity disfranchised The late Magistrates have of which copy will be found- lovers of the old close ystem will be able to prevail with as many to accept of legal meeting of council In this state of there is office under the recent election as will make up constitution better calculated than it has been to ARBROATH the inhabitants have recentl diap layed as have also conducted themselves with liberality and the have liad the privilege of naming yielded every reason to hope that this also obtain secure the public interest anil welfare of the community In much desire of reform as of Montrose the old and new Deacons of the Trades who from time immemorial convener who is ex councillor to the public feeling and at tlic election for this majority of votes In DUNDEE year convened the whole members of tlie several corporations and appointed tlic convener by old faction have succeeded in the elections but the system has been so skilfully and amply exposed it may bo considered as vanquished In PAISLEY as will be seen from the resolutions come to on the 29 th instant which we give at length in another part of our paper the inhabitants arc determined to maintain their rights and regain what ot lias been lost Their struggle commenced moro than year ago and although their Magistrates endeavoured to prevent the meeting was on the 5 th of July 1816 from taking place and tried to them out of the recent meeting this conduct had the effect as it generall and naturall lias of rendering the more watchful and stimulating them to greater exertions They seem to unite ge with temperance and we have no doubt therefore of their ultimate success Sinister designs we trust will no longer prosper in our northern and if Magistrates would make this part of their creed they would never fail in securing tlie respect and attachment of their fellow-citizens When they adopt another creed it is the duty as it seems at present to be the disposition of the inhabitants to follow all their tortuous courses and detect and expose every unfair or corrupt transaction In such endeavours while accompanied with prudence we shall be forward to assist the inhabitants of all or any of our burghs by every means in our power struggle has commenced in London which in point of temporary To the unthinking it may appear of of the metropolis but when we advert to tlie state of aro all suspended that all we do or sa of ministers that the faction which SMITH supports plight and that WOOD and his friends have done yoke we shall be convinced that it is importance is far beyond we Iiave yet noticed small moment whether WOOD or SMITH shall occupy the civic the nation to the facts that our rights
