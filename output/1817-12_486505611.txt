Persuasive to Moderation shall now endeavour to tread in your -ps not because entertain tlie smallest suspicion of the intentions of any person now stirring in the laudable work of Burgh but because pro- Bperity generally is apt to intoxicate and because it is always bet ter to prevent to cure Public spirit at least the expression of it is new to Scotland Of late however it has acquired great strength to the most beneficial results To meet and to many who are about to- have that 3 ut can produce no harm to recommend firmness and perseverance It is on such occasions that men are forgetting dial the ten tio iis ii is generally with and if regulated will soon trust matters of publie right honour and as novel situations ari trying it may in tlie union of prn moderation with in danger of allowing zeal 6 outrun ot justify rash ness and that presumption and want of mountains atc not to lie-removed In these any one effort of faith or reason Such work is npw accomplished by mining and

voice to moment however much that good may fait short of their own wishes In common life they that both men to enjoy nil the innocent pleasures wi and although desire always outstrips the means and attainable improvement it is not carried to philosophy and religion their although many conceivable pleasures be still wanting of gratification So in politics we should never reject any limited the full extent of abstract ri ghts am persuaded are not called for by any spirit 1 am misinformed if in some country burghs an and Trades and to up set like This is acting most These remarks which has yet appeared in Edinburgh But attempt lias not been to sow dissension between the Guildry given as constitution inconsiderate and foolish part for unanimity is at present of such immense consequence hat alone had almost ssid of any were to continue unanimous for any magistracy Elections would be carried agreeably to set them aside and in tin manner set of tbe burgh be description which may not be accomplished by oii of language as it persons is any good to be If ins public only one year they would be sure to triump over the wish of these bodies or means would be found to magistrates would be got to concur or word see nothing of moderate unanimity But to insure unanimity there- and moderation also jfl the degree present -bo what was of reform Nothing at conceded to Montrose not only
