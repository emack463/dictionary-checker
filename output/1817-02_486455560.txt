Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)Now aa tlie present times exhibit in all these respects complete to the times of 179 what is it that we have to dread cnn justify the smallest on the

that evil designing persons arc at work to destroy tlic frame remark which occurs here is after the of our laws and arms which led to tlie establishment of his most Christian majesty at the opening of the last session of its results and more likely to be lasting than strange that spirit of discontent should in time of peace to keep it from breaking speech recently delivered in parliament lid and

part of the population had long felt the burden of thc system -had long seen to where it tended but till taxation had reached its acme their voice had not been heard Till the pressure reached the upper ranks the influence of ministers was able to the voice of the people And this while it accounts as we have said most fully for the discontent of tlie people proof of their great patience and forbearance But if the cause of of attempting to gag the mouths of tlic people It is wiser certainly to apply cure may be accomplished than to cover it the evil be known why not remove it instead that they may not be heard complaining of it the proper remedy to the sore that over till rottenness undermine the system been accustomed to growing to extend transactions and by these means to increase
