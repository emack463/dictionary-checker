ON MODERN POETRYThe Scotsman (1817-1858)ON SjEOltERN POETRY In every work regard the writer end Since none can compass more than they intend POPE AFTER so papers on the subject of Burgh Reform some of bur readers will probably be anxious for change of diet but there are likewise others whose appetite for political discussion is too keen and hearty to be deceived or assuaged by literary kickshaws and who would do well to take damper out of or the BLACK-DWARF before they come our way this week We know not what excuse for wandering from the region of pure politics will serve with these rampant and ravenous lions who hunger after strong meat and to whom Town-Council is mere bite but even if their displeasure were ot over we should still find enough to flout at the notion of Weekl Journal filling up its first leaf with discourse on poetry We shall however at least obtain the approbation of tlie Magistrates by cessation of hostilities and if we write nonsense we may perhaps please some other readers by anticipating their own conceptions Most modern poets have distinguished themselves rather communicating to the ub lic some strong and peculiar impression which had accidentally taken hold of their own minds than by any employment of the inventive faculty Each confines himself to certain circle of materials and seems to have foresworn the use of all others It doe learned or observant as some of the older reception of every sort of impression which would serve not appear that any one of them is so schools or keeps his mind equally open for the the purposes of poetry

one set of ideas more than another exc ih GO far as they are calculated to stir excite and human mind This would-be the character of one who estimated the value of poetical materials philosophically But posing and interesting concep ns wherever they are to be it has generally been found that poetry cannot be composed by setting so coolly to work and tnat when the faculties ar too watchful is generally dispersion of those fine feelings which serve as sort of key-note for calling together poetical thoughts Judgment is quite unable to detect the relations which bind ideas together into poetry Feeling alone can do it but feeling is so much modified by circumstances and associations that we seldom find it any individual with abstract propriety and if we turn loose oui sical judgment upon its assemblages we shall act as cruelly towards poetical inspiration as the civil authority does at present- towards London citizens of whom fifty cannot meet without being told that some wrong person is there We therefore think Mr COLERIDGE should be- to introduce his owls his old mastiff in CKristebel without critic reading the act to ti ideas of mad poet shouid be added-to-the exhibition

BYRON commenced sentiment imagination which is quite different thing and indeed is very rare at all times since we do century Poetical sentiment is merely by it is compatible with an exclusive principle and likes it -but imagination is an universal Repeated instances have proved that very limited range of ideas nay that it is even limited range because varied ideas are apt to disturb love

example of vivid sentiment or moral enthusiasm poetry is certainly preferable to images like DARWIN or that of observation the understanding of the in perusing poetry of sentiment the means consisting

that of POPE awakens the mind into state of sustained for almost any length of time or monotony since the interest of it is derived from distant ideas collected of great many homogeneous ideas activity which may be without any feeling of the contrasts and comparisons of dissimilar and from wide field and riot from tlie aggregation brought to bear on one point human thoughts is not unlimited and considerable exhausted In so far as poetry consists in selecting nature or of the external world or in describing The range of part of it lias already been the ideal beautiful either of human situations of imaginary felicity we car hardly now these subjects Virtue and perfection are not elements must always be the same DAVIC expect poets to discover any unanticipated conceptions on susceptible of many different aspects because their real HUME observes truth is one thing while falsehood is unlimited in its varieties The same thing may bo said of the ideal beautiful both of mind and matter It is probable that the ancients would perceive cloying similarity in the lineaments and proportions of their best statues because no artist could diverge very far Trom certain standard without forsaking his object Tlie contention and emulation of sculptors would draw them closer and closer to centre The conceptions are circumscribed within certain natural boundary but there is no boundary to the variety of the conceptions of HOGARTH because he does at drawing perfection but at characterising ty and imperfection which are infinite In the same although heroic poetry may be considered as nearly exhausted the world will for ever continue to supply materials to the novelist and the satirist and even to the painter of moral energies and affections when like he takes them with such compounds as occur in real life without attempting to abstract them into the sublime So completely does the ideal beautiful appear to be exhausted that poets for some years back have been obliged to represent their heroes as villanous and immoral retaining of course the staple article of strength of mind There is no doubt charm about the idea of great mental energy but moral would still have been retained as an ingredient in the picture if it had not become trite and threadbare The case is the same on the stage Sir GILES OVERREACH BERTRAM and RICHARD the Third proclaim aloud
