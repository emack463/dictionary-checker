ON THE LATE TRIALSThe Scotsman (1817-1858)ON THE LATE TRIALS What spectacle indeed can be more sublime than to see blind system of jealous and arbitrary dominion carried on the profligate and corrupting agency of spies in every part of tlie kingdom receive as it were deathblow from twelve honest men indifferently chosen out of the undistinguished mass of our people Part II im enemies we think must allow that we have never sought notoriety by indulging in personal abuse or invective against individuals Our warfare has been against systems and proceedings that appeared hostile to public liberty Our doctrines have been those of the British constitution Our praise has been given to all who have supported constitutional principles because our first desire has been to cherish and disseminate them We have never been afraid or ashamed to avow that many laws have crept into our code not in the spirit of our Constitution and which therefore might and ought to be repealed but we always had the persuasion ako that if all practices in the face of law -unauthorised by law -and inconsistent with every fair view of public and official duty were ref ormed there would be much less discontent and great deal more happiness in the country In short it is favourite notion of ours that of late public men have attended too little to the characters and principles of those whom they employed and from whom the grounds of legislative enactments and they have taken reports and informations as criminal proceedings almost uniform opposition given by Parliament and still more perhaps than half of the press at constantly principle and practice and defending every has ever received mission from any member Another great cause of discontent is the Ministers to inquiry by the conduct of their satellites out of Parliament who with more their disposal are advocating every unconstitutional one however worthless and infamous of administration It is this line of conduct which has brought suspicion on all public characters man has committed an error if inquiry appeal io character then all men in office come to be hatred and disaffection grow up in the For if it never be allowed that public he resisted and discussion quashed by an doubted alike distrust is sown in every direction and hatred and dislike not by prosecutions for libel But let Ministers characters arc men who may err give every minus of the less educated and less discriminating -a to be eradicated but encouraged acknowledge that they and all public and who must err let facility to inquiry let guilt be punished minor offences exposed errors will bo loved and respected Even in cases where gross errors could have the magnanimity to acknowledge in future conduct arid generosity in the public It is tlic no interest in the proper justly irritates the people corrected and the Government and its servants been committed if the public officer and promise reparation he would find enough of treating of them witli contempt as if they had administration of public affairs that We have been led into in the trial of ANDREW MKiNLAY before the Justiciary this train of reflection by some circumstances which transpired Court of which pretty full account will be found in the ther columns of our paper and we have here stated what much from its obvious connection with the trial as from its forming sort of key to our own sentiments on subject of some importance We repeat that we take no pleasure in questions of personal nature We have studied indeed to avoid them -But thus arose in our minds not so come forward as Journalists our duty to the public is paramount We have praised and must again praise where delicacy and propriety would forbid it if we yielded to private feeling For the same reason we dare not shrink from censuring when the public call is imperious however painful we may feel it as individuals -tn our present characters we arc known to no-one and should know nothing but what is or may be known to the public at large Besides the trial of on the merits of tlie crime alleged against him our readers must remember that great deal of discussion took place before the Judges on ihe relevancy of two prior indictments and on the competency of withdrawing one indictment after it had been pleaded to and substituting another in its stead Much noise was made on these topics both in and out of Parliament and we refrained from adverting to them not from any desire to compromise our duty but with the hope of every day being possessed of full report of all the proceedings That report however though iii great forwardness is not yet printed and we must therefore offer our remarks on such information as we have otherwise been able to obtain We have no Iiesitation then in admitting that we never thought that there was any justice against the LORD ADVOCATE for incapacity and incorrect and in his treatment of the State Prisoners in this known that he has we know no lawyer at the bar on his possesses more legal knowledge or who of profiting from the practice of the greatest legal autho in the charges intentional severity The latter we are sure is country it is now well displayed the greatest humanity As to the former again own side of politics who has had more personal practice or so many opportunities father-in-law tile LORD PRESIDENT BLAIR must be The papers of his father Lord MEADOWBANK and of his at his command and his immediate descent from one of these great lawyers and his near connection witli us with securities for In exercising the almost unlimited powers constitutionally beyond what can be found shall therefore regret place in the office of His the other must in tlic of motive present vested in him legally and in any other lawyer of Tory principles We change which may take Majesty Advocate for Scotland under the present administration The indictments EDGAR and of ability but to display disposition to elevate circumstances could support -a disposition manifested did not appear to us to betray want the character offence charged beyond what the actual in our opinion by the ATToRNEY-Gr NEiiAr in England in in cases lias always struck us to be the same higher Crown lawyers as forming part of the existing feelings and selected by them for an Crown lawyers been the ardent supporters of the present Ministers the late trials for High Treason The reason We uniformly considered tlie administration -partaking in all their views and accordance in political sentiments At all events the present especially in carrying tlic Suspension of tlie Habeas Carpzis Act measure which they were most anxious to accomplish Here then the root all the evil Miniaters having taken an alarm or affected one communicated it to others and the Iiost at creatures who are continually gasping for profit or favour perceiving how much information was desired to show the alarm was not unfounded got up body of what was considered evidence of seditions plots and treasons Scarcely any man will now be enough to assert that the Privy Council and the Crown lawyers were not imposed upon They saw what no impartial bystander could see and felt what he could not feel They spoke and voted under wrong impressions and after going tlic length they did they were bound in order to give colour of truth to their statements to attempt to make out sonic one case or other of treason or treasonable practices This is our theory respecting all the trials in England and Scotland and it is for the public on due consideration of all the circumstances to judge whether we arc or arc not in the right It is in this manner that we account for the LORD ADVOCATE persevering in serving one indictment after another on EDGAR and We cannot however approve of its been done even with the Court because it is impossible to convince us the Constitution to compel man wlio lias pleaded The precedents in favour of the competency of we can learn exceedingly instance brought this had been an unchallenged to give up even questionable the consent of that it is accordant with tlic liberal spirit of not guilty to one indictment to undergo trial upon such proceeding are in so far as scanty and were never perhaps in more than one before the Court Tlierc is no doubt however that practice and we seldom find any officer inclined privilege In tlie present case we can see strong inducement to the contrary Tills was tlic first case in laid on tlie act founded on -an act which we rage for legislating which great adds one more to the list of our capital death without benefit of clergy to administer or to be purporting or intending to bind tlic taker and it docs this adverting sufficiently to the bearing of an an indictment had been cannot Iiel viewing as an instance of that Lord ERSKINE considers as the vice of tlic times It statutory crimes by making it present at administering an oath to commit treason murder or any capital felony in our apprehension on tlie existing treason law and llic mode of administering that law in Scotland There was thus on this statute no little difficulty in framing an indictment to the facts alleged the prosecutor to state the specific treason was every reason to suppose th it this could not be if we tlie indictment was it done at all Hut still think with Lord ILI IRS that if llic prosecutor could peculiar trra iun or the oath purported or made out for llic consideration of Jury in tlie case of llie prisoners If it was incumbent on felony which the oath bound the taker to there done consistently with facts of tlic case Nor notwithstanding tin decision of tlie majority of Court not or would not state specifically to hind the inker to commit vas no casu Other objections of no small
