Editorial Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)On Monday night thS Chancellor of tlic Exchequer submitted to tlie House of Commons lie terms plan for relieving the public distresses 1 500 000 of Exchequer bills arc to be entrusted to Commissioners empowered to advance loans to Corporations Trustees of roads Public Bodies or Individuals to be expended in constructing works of general utility in Britain and 230 000 for the same purposes in Ireland Interest is to be charged on the advances at per cent and security for their repayment ie to be taken on tlic Poor Rates or on tlie funds of tlie Corporations or public bodies applying for loans Various objections have been urged against tlie manner in this relief is to be administered and in our opinion it would have been better to have advanced the money at once requiring any security and to have char ged it to the current of tlic It will in many instances be extremely difficult to find proper security for advances and in parishes the poor where of course tlie distress is extreme no security liad been of temporary and evanescent nature and if this have nearly swallowed up tlie rental and can be given If tlic distresses of tlie country sum had been freely given as bonus the measure might perhaps are of very different kind it to prop up ruinous and destructive system It people and lending it to load of calamity which wei ghs down the country been deserving of eulogy but as the distresses can only be considered as an expedient is not by drawing money from tlic pockets of the Corporations and Churchwardens to be expended on public works that the will ever be lightened Such palpable absurdity can impose on no one Tins mortgage their estates for tlie support of tlie poor and as effective enough to annihilate the scheme is in fact nothing but an inducement to landlords to the poor laws alread they were surely of the count and to scheme for tlie relief of the poor deserves the least of Although ten or twenty classes it would not afford them any real relief unless steps to reproduce and preserve it When this urn was spent their necessity for new donation would be equally propagate pauperism No attention which has not for its object to render them millions were gratuitously given the labouring were at rti sami time taken to enable them situation would be as abject as before and the strong and imperative fourth part of the people of England can neither be of individuals Our endeavours ought to be supported by the charity of the public nor immediately and steadily directed to those obstacles which obstruct the natural employment up fictitious system at tlie of both because tJw Government requires too large share enough left to support themselves Let therefore of drawing GO or 70 millions from the with 20 or 30 millions But let us not the removing of capital and labour and not to the bolstering It is whatever the Treasury scribes may say to the contrary of the produce of labour labourers have not this share be reduced lit the Government in place people in tlie form of taxes be content ourselves by stupidly imagining that the giving back taxes as loans or that the forcing have any other consequence but tlie still more rapid capital to make up tlie deficiency of revenue can dissemination of wretchedness no temporary relief should ever be administered in cases of national to be remedied by means But in system founded on delu sTon and replete believe to be the fact -that unless policy unless our overwhelming debt is reduced no expedients or real advantage proof if any proof liad We arc far from insinuating that suffering Temporary distresses may and this instance we conceive we should be countenancing witli mischief if we did not state what we thorough charge is effected in our domestic hitc the present can be productive of any permanent been wanting that Ministers have no intention to take any eff steps to opposition to Mr motion for abolishing or reducing tlie duties on salt This as the rich is loaded with an excessive directly increased tlic comforts of tlic labourer but it would the fisheries and facilitating tlic neglected department of industry These arguments made Mr motion wu of course negatived alleviate tlic public distresses may be found in their Coinniitteli to inquire into the expediency of essential necessary indispensable to the poor impost and its reduction would not only have have dono so indirectly by employment of thousands of seamen in that no impression on our benevolent administration and If tlic above is pretty intelligible commentary on the be of Ministers and on their inclination to lessen our burdens the continuing the Lottery with all its odious an of puffing deceit and deception happily illustrates their extreme solicitude for the purity of public morals and for tlic suppression of gambling Since our leading article of to-day was put to press intelligence has been received from South America of the occu pation of Monte-Video by the Portuguese troops Althbuili we regret this event we do not consider it as calculated per to injure the patriotic cause It appears certain that the Brazilian and Spanish courts arc at variance and PliRDiNANi will probably endeavour to make reprisals in Europe for he considers as an invasion of Ins territories in America There arc other circumstances however which will certainly prevent tlic Portuguese from involving in dangerous war with the Republicans Tlie slave population is more numerous in Brazil than in any other part of America and is extremely discontented If the Brazilian government therefore is improvident to engage in hostilities its opponents will not want powerful and determined allies and this country as well as the rest of South America will become so -if the Brazilians could safely extend their in the conquered provinces would be preferable Portugal and Brazil now changed places The of the latter will no longer be restricted
