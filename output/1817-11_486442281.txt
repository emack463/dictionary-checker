Editorial Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)We tin day insert very interesting account of some of tlie proceedings of the notorious OLIVER as connected with the late Derbyshire riots first published in The Times of the 31 st ult This document for the correctness of the facts stated in which the Editor of The Times has ledged himself will be read with much interest It gives an account of the different expeditions of this licensed ruffian from tlie 17 th of April to the 7 th of June inclusive On tbe day last mentioned he was introduced to society at Nottingham by Mr BURKIN who lias ever since been in custody and on the same evening Brandreth anil iwo others lucre sent lo take view of tlie Barracks On the day BRANDRETH was at lie VIiiteliorse Inn Pcntrulge and the outrages followed 1 Such are the facts of the case That OLIVER instigated BRANDRETH and his associates to commit acts of rebellion wilt of course be denied The natural presumption however arising out of the circumstances just stated not to mention the positive declarations of almost every person with whom OLIVER had conversed is not to be got rid of by the mere averments of few hired writers That an intriguing scoundrel with his pockets stuffed with the produce of taxation and to be acquainted with and recommended by the known and popular advocates of liberal principles should acquire an instant ascendancy in conclave composed of few starving be doubted It must been coin- labourers cannot pletely in po ver shape their resolutions as lie judged proper And tlie strict coincidence in point of
