ON THE PRESENT CRISIS OF STYLE IN LITERATUREThe Scotsman (1817-1858)ON THE PRESENT CRISIS OF STYLE IN LITERATURE His name is Talkative he is tlic son of one Say-well who dwelt in Prating-row IM STYLE is modified by the prevailing opinions of the age in whi ch writer lives in the same manner that personal behaviour is regulated by those existing modes which for the time have obtained the approbation of society In prose writing bold indulgence of peculiarity is apt to be ascribed either to boorish ignorance of literary ton or else to selfconfidence which deserves to be run down In the formation of personal manners individuals of more than ordinary grace at first give law to society but society having in the course of time established certain code gives law with the utmost rig our to individuals and even compels the dereliction of graces which are not sanctioned by custom In the same manner public opinion at last bestrides men of genius like the night-mare and scarcely permits genius is of no avail But surely we them only compilation of something more than jingle of expressions meaning We expect something more than stale repetition the to consider as elegant any purpose unless he has sufficient courage movement of that self-will without which do not take lip books to find in jargon which is current in every mouth We expect which havebeen repeated till they scarce retain any froth of words which by dint of perseverance and public have been taught pleasantry No person will write to and egotism to prefer his own ideas to those of society One of public opinion over private talent is the and the abandonment powers of ths mind People who stand in awe run into those walks of literature where the smallest hazard of committing themselves The man incur no other the most remarkable effects of the cultivation of speculative habits in preference to all others of what may be called the creative of public opinion they can expatiate with who aims at-no more than bare reasoning can disgrace than that of reasoning -1 He does not put forth any substantive conceptions of his own He merely compares ideas and although he says nothing to bring himself off by few facts or an attempt to from them is only pregnable on attempt at original conception number of causes very new or striking may easily ingenious observations well strung together statement of deduce consequences the score of truth and falsehood The shame of an unsuccessful is far more intense and arises from greater Hence the enormous shoals moral and political metaphysicians critics which we at present of speculators theorists and rationale-givers of every description and hence also llie bears the stamp called genius in contradistinction to intellect It is all tlic island to tlie other We have so many persons by which every thing is accomplished that knowledge is power but in matters of genius general want among prose writers of any tiling of what is hubbub from one end of who understand the reason of every tiling and lie means nothing is accomplished at all Lord says it seems to be quite the reverse turns out to be impotence We are like the inhabitants of Balnibarbi as described by Dean SWIFT in his voyage to the Fl ying Island who had so many excellent contrivances in agriculture and knew the theory of it so well that they had never been able to raise single crop In seeking sufficient reasons for every thing we have at last fallen under the influence of sufficient reason for growing of dignity which op rate as sort Again our speculators possess immense advantages in point of can stand aloof at their case and censure those who labour superiority and they do nothing themselves can done in presence The carpenter who makes bad table our metaphysician tells him ith tables This is what Madame de STAEL calls for enlisting among them They in other departments with an air of triumphant at least point out better way of doing is must endure every sort reply for gentleman-like air that it is not his trade to make triumph of supercilious mediocrity making these remarks In we do not mean to glance at the critical bench of ornaments some of whom have certainly can be exhibited in their own walk strong-handed police to settle their claims and repress tlie well-earned ascendancy which certain writers have gained over authority even if they were tried by freely who have written well We would call the present day at not at its principal as much original genius as age so prolific of authors requires their absurdities We therefore do not regret to see public taste since they would be found entitled to their present the severe canon of POPE those alone should censure only mean to point out the of what sico- -stricture-brandishing -rationale-giving mania This mania in the hi gher walks of of what is called genius in contradistinction to have said let us inquire into the fate two ways viz either in making satirical strictures and observations on conceptions which are humourous in themselves like SHAKESiEAn we could call critical humour and it consists exists The second we would call inventive humour ideas which at once prose literature has almost entirely superseded tlie mere intellect To exemplify what we has befallen wit and humour These faculties may be exercised in real characters and events -or in evoking out of nothing Falslaff or SWIFTS fictitious travels The first merely in detecting tlie ludicrous where it alread and it consists in producing original lease by novelty and raise merriment by comic force Now tlie humour of the present age is almost same causes all authors aspire to tlie character hazard strictures upon persons and to bring forward creations for such compositions as Don Quixote Gil Gulliver Clinker Candidc or Sentimental Journey If any of mankind requisite for performances lie employs cannot be filled up by any Observes or Dissertations generally sink into entirely critical nnd lifts become so owing to the of It has been found safer to of our own It is in vain we look around us Travels Tom Humphry person alive possesses llie wit invention and them in different way and leaves woeful blank which however smart because compositions in that form oblivion along witli the topics produced them All knowledge of mankind is now concentrated into general propositions that is to say into cold insipid metaphysical shadows -and is no longer embodied in vivid pictures or exemplified in amusin incidents Our writings arc grown equally wise and tiresome We have almost nothing left except philosophy but philoso phy has grown so as to become drug and we wonder men of talent have not in fit of spleen returned to their former occupations As for novel-writing it is for tlie most part left to inferior at least our novels do not embody tlie best of tlie age as they did in tlie time ot SWIFT and VOLTAIRE Novels have sunk into mere mechanical pictures of existing manners They take no range Human nature appears under only one aspect in them and tlie utmost stretch of the writer invention is generally to describe was said at fashionable gala To rank novel among classical compositions it is necessary that it should have to give it permanent purchase over the human mind Tlie joys and described must be more intense and less the offspring of factitious circumstances than those of beau or belle Tlie contrasts of character must also be stronger and more calculated to bring into view the general condition of mankind and tlie varied operations of passions amidst the business If novel wants these ingredients it must at least have great gusto in tlie style and much felicity and originality in llic manner Our best modern novels arc of Miss EDGEwoli and tlie Author We suspect tlio 1 with all their attractions want tlie standard qualities above mentioned and will hardly go down to inventions exhausted times and although without nature exhibit very strong stamina
