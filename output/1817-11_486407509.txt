Go Britannique Par Paris 1817 That the general diffusion of political knowledge and of lie just principles policy of scorns abundantly certain Among the various reasons which the politicians of the last century and their followers in the present have assigned for considering France and Britain as tlie natural enemies of each other the-similarity of their pursuits lias never been forgotten Botli countries were addicted to commerce -each of them possessed distant and contiguous colonies and each abounded in various commodities which were also the product of tlie other In such circumstances and it was universally admitted that one country gained by its external commerce must be at tlie expense of some other it was natural that very keen rivalry or rather enmity should take place between independent states whose interests apparently in so many particulars 11 is not probable such erroneous and absurd opinions will long continue to exercise any considerable influence on national policy Ill informed prejudiced and vulgar minded as Statesmen generally arc the increasing knowledge and liberality of the age will ultimately force its way into the closets of princes and their ministers And the labours of SMITH and of RICARDO and of tlie other men by llie science of political economy lias been created and perfected ill ultimately rid humanity of tlie complicated and incalculable mischiefs induced by commercial antipathies and In as far therefore as regards feelings and prejudices arising out of commercial competition there seems every reason to in the progress of society shall become identical on lie part of governments and of their subjects But it is otherwise in matters purely political Their apparent and interests will there be generally opposite Thus it ought

powerfully contributing to the sprc ul of liberty and of right feeling throughout tlie world Witli governments however tlie case is entirely different Their real indeed when viewed comprehensively corn spond exactly willi those of their subjects but have never considered them in and it is probable never will The successive depositaries of the supreme power naturally anxious for individual gratification and uncertain as to tlie duration of their authority be expected to sacrifice their own particular tastes and partialities for tlie general The love of power must be tlie leading motive uf conduct -because they arc themselves despotic they must constitute the natural friends and allies of other despots -and they therefore view lie progress of liberal opinions with jealous and jaundiced eye Tlie history of Great Britain as well as of tlie other countries of Europe sufficiently corroborates tlie truth of these remarks and establishes the necessity of the public having an
