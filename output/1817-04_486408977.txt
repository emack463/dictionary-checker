Editorial Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)Marshal MASSENA Prince of Esling died at Paris on Friday the 4 th instant aged 59 He was one of the ablest and 3 nost successful of those great officers whom the French Re Volution raised to distinction The great blemish in his cha eter asin English was avarice Report by Mr OWEN of New Lanark detailing plan for the relief of the manufacturing and labouring poor lias been laid before Parliament and published by the association for their support We have given some extracts from it in another part of this paper but we confess we do not it of any great importance We differ entirely from Mr OWEN in his views respecting machinery So far from considering its general employment as being the immediate cause of the present distresses we are fully convinced it has greatly alleviated them and that every invention which adds to its power and efficacy conduces to the best interests of society We have opinion in our leading article of to-day our readers shortly stated our reasons for this and we hope they will appear satisfactory to We consider that part of Mr OWEN scheme or rather we say workhouses containing from 120 0 to principle and impracticable from its Till such time as rest on natural and permanent principles any resources foreign to own exertions such dependence and economy and must proportionally strengthen their vicious

depravity of tlic lower classes Witli submission however to tl csc gentlemen it appears to us that tlic measures if an unprincipled and ignorant administration at least liad fully us to do in producing this lamentable result as thc of few twopenny pamphlets Poverty is in all cases the great and in this instance almost tlie sole cause of crime But it is owing to the profligate waste of tlie national resources to taxation and to tlie monopoly granted to the agriculturists the physical wants of the people of Britain are become greater than their power to satisfy It is our economical position or the total inadequacy of the ways of labour to purchase tlie indispensable necessaries of life and not the want of religious or virtuous feelings this country than in all Europe besides
