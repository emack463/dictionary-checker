Front Page 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)Qua readers wo suspect will to think that our this subject is somewhat tenacious We it-is strong but we trust it is not without cason The honour of Scotland the interests of good sense and the-triumph or failure of liberal principles seem all to be in it and witli this impression we proceed at the risk of being thought tedious to aper few additional observations which will conclude what we mean to say on the subject for the present In our discussions we have pointed out at length the evils and absurdities of the existing or constitutions andin that respect Mps essential sety ice has beep conferred on the by very judicious publication under the title Documents connected with the Question of Ro-Ebrm in the Boroughs of Scotland In this valuable compilation will befound short historical deduction of the government of Burghs he various Scots acts on the subject and many other papers the in London Sir Thomas Dundas

obtaining from Parliament in Scotland This last-mentioned document not onj breathes an excellent of facts although the Burghs were introduction and extension of commerce and manufactures yet 29 the pernicious principle of and which fully warrant the conclusion free and possessed constitutions well calculated for the since the passing of the Act 96 introduced into the Councils by that act has been universally or with care and even extended and enlarged while statute which could any way be salutary to the departed from and totally of this system are irregularities and almost universally preserved on the other hand every thing contained in any communities of the Burghs has been neglected or abandoned Among the abuses which arose out injustice in the levying in name of cess sums tar -undue alienations of the public property to the revenues and of debt to of soldiers beyond what is legal magistrates councillors their friends or connections -misapplication of the great danger and of the inhabitants taxing the citizens without legal authority public -electing non-residents to preside and vote various respects -and many ether These evils have been in much stronger language than

narratives old acts of Parliament and by ill ow insti- tutional writers they are commented on with great severity by Lord KAMES and he who does not perceive them at the present day may bo considered as lost to reason as much as he who can defend them will be devoid of honesty As-the struggle becomes more serious however we shall find defenders start up abundance or in all events pretexts will be sought for keeping things as they are and of these 1 Wnfe will be demand in each articular case of What mischief has arisen here to call for change-A question which never would be put if those urging it were not previously aware of the danger and difficulty of answering it Historically and generally it maybe and lias been often answered fully and completely But when it is put with respect to particular magistrates tlie demanders of the proof are those who withhold the evidence The accused have dominant power over the evidence of their own misdemeanours and for this reason and this only it becomes matter of great to No legal means exist by inhabitants of burgh can compel their magistrates in account Jbr their or exhibit fi thy burgh af-Jairs It is maxim of have title and interest to do

popular actions against Magistrates per sons but our law has not made this importation It think in the case of revenue is vested in this fictitious existe nce title nor interest in law to institute

state objections as they had to the writers on that these acts as we mentioned in our last on trial of Exchequer to which by two statutes Magistrates were proceedings and statements of the funds under their being annually cited also to the accounts of their governors But although our law had laid it down were in force it was found in Excliequcr Feb 1787 desuetude and could not be enforced Tlie that

course and tic themselves up from challenging the conduct of their predecessors And when the great powers vested in these self-elected and uncontrolled Burgli Councils are taken into consideration it is impossible to figure system more hostile to reason and every principle of expediency or which should contain in itself more elements and corruption These evils must result from such system and while it continues in operation it is insulting common sense -it is libelling tlie human understanding to ask in particular case for direct and special proofs of mismanagement Another revolting feature of this system is the contrast between the impunity enjoyed the Magistrates wlio cannot be called to account by the inhabitants and the responsibility of the Burgesses who are by all tlie acts
