expectations uld been Saw disappointed but they have been realized in their utmost extent 3 vcn the Treasury writers ill hardly venture to tell us that the situation of an overburdened country sinking under an enormous taxation and whose revenue is 14 or 15 millions short of its expenditure is to be perceptibly improved by saving of 90 000 orL 100 000 per annum It it said man will catch at straw but abject as the situation ofJOHN BULL undoubtedly is we hardly think li will lay hold of the Finance Report as resource in his extremity We have already stated that except in so far as retrenchments

allude arc 119 cases in criminal jurisprudence which awaken the feelings of trials for crimes against the State Actions that the property and government strike at an object in which every person of judicial procedure with- indifference are ready to zeal But period of civil dissention is naturall productive of sonic degree of alarm and where no real cause apprehensions of their weaker neighbours

candid man will be anxious against tlic State should have the full benefit really enjoys We say this without the sli reference to the trials already concluded But it -is evident the institution of Juries the state of the VllCll the public mind is in its calm and -tlie circumstances of gradations of guilt which exist in state of punishment except death places mnn altogether also take into view those circumstances which should govern way be in the eye of the law No person th at public of much importance to the equity of judicial natural shrt Mane and considerate will tlic case and carefully attend to those shades and crimes as in common offences and since no degree beyond the reach of public opinion they will their judgment of the individual whatever his case who reflects can doubt of tlic equity of this mode of proceeding Speaking in moral point of view men engage in against the State wickedly when they arc instigated by private cupidity or sonic as leads to attack property of their neighbour when they net from erroneous ideas of social improvement when they arc not aware of tlic consequences of their actions We leave it to the lawyers to say hew far these distinctions appl to the princi les of criminal law we ara sure they deserve attention when we attempt to forni moral estimate of the conduct of the individual the feelings of those who judge aright towards person brought to tlio bar of public justice for-crimes against the State will vary according as the acts etl one or of these classes There besides in-the very nature of the case that makes to the best feelings of our nature It is an unequal struggle between the State and an individual All the powers of Government all the influence of long-established authority and are arrayed against private person
