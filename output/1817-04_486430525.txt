ON THE LOVE OF GLORYThe Scotsman (1817-1858)ON THE LOVE OF GLORY i- How glorious then Fit luxury for gods to save tlie good Protect the feeble dash bold vice aside Ocprcei the wicked and tlie frail Thomsm THE love of glory is one of the noblest though often the most mischievous of In our own times the love of military glory lias predominated and the necessary consequence has been bloody protracted and ruinous wars This however appears to us to be the most vulgar species of the passion It is more common more easily caught and requires less information and comprehension to sustain it than any other The glory of being great useful and benevolent Statesman is tlie highest since it requires tlie union of the greatest talents and the most extensive personal acquisitions To be First Minister in any country is to fill an office which may be exercised for tlie accomplishment of and noble purposes but to be Premier of Great Britain is to occupy the most enviable and exalted office in the world We say this of course in reference to what Britain has been what she still may be and her first Minister ought to be statesman who is not impelled in his course by motives of the highest and purest character is despicable being and in country like this is entirely without excuse Where our Legislature sits it is literally surrounded witli monuments of British greatness One turn in Westminster Abbey should be sufficient to kindle flame of patriotism and he must be vulgar soul indeed who could not thus elevate his the present British statesman should live in should connect him with tlie past and sympathy eminent and useful in his own times He is to Spenser Shakespeare Milton Drydcn Pope Goldsmith Cowper-which and imbibe lessons from tlie past for regulating tlie contemplation of British lory History witli genius and talent should bind him to all that is legislate for the country which produced Chaucer Ferguson Millar Palcy-which produced Edward III Abcrcroniliy -which produced Hampdcn and -which in word produced host of great names produced Bacon Lockc Newton Blackstone Hunic Sinitli tlie Black Prince Henry Marlborougli Blake Nelson Moore and Russell and Chatham and Fox and Wliithreild omitted in this brief catalogue Yet we have named to incite to the noblest exertions of to history alone that tlie statesman is left for genius which lie lias to rival and which temple of fame In besides Campbell and names of tlie order In genius and valour and patriotism But it is not excitement There is an ample stock of living and docs not leave him without competition in tlie Scott and Byron we might enumerate many science moral have Stewart Miiltlms Davy Leslie Playlair and of the first eminence And in all tlie departments very highest order We have physical and we many In the arts and polite literature we are possessed of letters we are favoured by writers of tlie more active more industrious and better informed any oilier on the globe And as by inf LTencc be the most and by experience None but person and feelings of the lower orders of this country will industry and information prevent crimes our people must virtuous This inference from principles is confirmed totally unacquainted witli tlie habits Tlieir at churches which they purchase and read any tlie great sail of missionary and other religious religious feelings To this let

resignation and fortitude ago- by any child-to the industry sobriety and patience of tlie family in general and he will no longer be able to resist conviction Then to lower population of this description generally we must add the middle ranks of life composed of individuals who possess for the most part every thing that goes to mes of parents -when lapse from virtue is exhibited the formation of an excellent and useful character Virtuous habits good sense good taste and range of information that would put to shame many of the philosophers of antiquity distinguish the middle classes in this country out of their ranks have sprung the-very ust our poets orators men of science philosophers historians arra statesmen The moral of all this is that as we arc the greatest country in the and in which di arms every thing and adorns civilized life so the contemplation of all this greatness ought to produce great statesmen Had tlie genius of the country been confined to poetry and tlie fine arts we should not required the soundest views of polltics from our statesmen but we arc not less distinguished for the most matured efforts of tlie judgment than for tlie highest workings of the The abstract sciences and above all political economy have been witli tlie utmost success The science of money the sources of national wealth and all the principles which arc involved in the most complicated questions of political science have investi patiently and so thoroughly that ignorance is now without the vestige of an apology Ho great might an honest and patriotic statesman become
