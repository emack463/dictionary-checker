submissive it is an approval of their measures it be strengthened We wish our countrymen were persuaded Great as the difficulties attending public meetings are there is no is resistance and requires that the executive government should tlie most decided and explicit measures are the heat other method that tlic prospect of arresting the course of we deem to who by rank and to conic and assert

oppression that may ensue from the system which contributed to overthrow Any minister may def tlie it once bo clearly made known and if would at least tlic comfort of knowing our slavery wai and that all of relief must be abandoned but we do not believe tlie expressed voice of tlic public would or could be disregarded When the anti-constitutional acts crc passed in February last an alarm had been previously raised by the Spafielda meetings the ridiculous alleged attempt upon the Tower and the attack upon tlie Prince Regent With these some weak minds might possibly connect tlic unusual spectacle of the majority of the labouring classes petitioning for Reform and arraigning the conduct of Adniiniitration in strong language It was easy to represent Acse as manifestations of treasonable spirit which had alread spread widely through tlic country Secret associations cre said to be formed on tlic princip les of universal pillage It was affirmed every village had its revolutionary club and tho country was literally covered with swarms of Spcnceans and traitors In short all the apparatus of conspiracy and insurrection were said to be prepared on the greatest scale and just read to operate It is true little or nothing of all these designs appeared but this circumstance was alleged as an aggravation of the danger Nothing is more easily got up than plot and there are periods when the most clumsy misrepresentations may be scut forth with an iir of probability The aspect of the times was singular Much existed and even man wlio thought favourably of tlie moral and constitutional spirit of the people did not know what and despair might do The effect of such impressions was to create of urity in the minds of many and some timid individuals wlio probably had no wish to subvert tlic Constitution began to think precautions necessary This panic answered tlic purpose of Miriisfcrs Without deliberation 01 farther inquiry Bills were passed suspending that many consented to tlic proposed not from trust and which it was supposed indisputable evidence Now these acts been more thim proofs of those great and imminent dangers with which were just ready to explode tlie Constitution But we conscientiously believe what was actually known but from what is taken upon time would enable them to confirm by three mouths in operation and we would ask arc tlie we were said to be menaced Where arc those plots that and hosts of for whose was judged necessary to arm tlio executive restriction that could shackle motions tlic country lias apprehension it with unconstitutional powers Ministers have been delivered from every been laid at feet and liberty given them if they to select victims where and they art of any importance has taken place which tlie

Not one laws in tin ir ordinary state were not glit but was detected and defeated two months sensation in the country than that of Nor will any one venture to a- that tlic tlic means of bringing to

brought to trial for sli ght one of whom lias been acquitted niid the other two subjected to few mouths imprisonment Other two individuals arc about to be tried but all of them have been indicted for crimes cognisable hy the existing laws of tlie land and we arc not of single instance in which tlic extraordinary deemed essential for tlie preservation of the Constitution have been found of any practical service Yet we cannot suppose that Government at such crisis would select tlic lesser criminals for prosecution and leave tlie greater unpunished When therefore we compare tlic predictions of danger held out with thu insignificant vast lowers put in motion with tlic feel more and more convinced that great exaggeration appears every day more strony and striking that the to have been
