of demand tor the latter especially in the numerous manufactories of printed calicoes However they continued to work because better times were hoped for anj because tlie workmen wlio have generally numerous families would otherwise have been ruined But as tlie demand continued to diminish it was found necessary to proceed to reductions in our nei at Miihlhausen in the Since tlie last Frankfort fair where our manufacturers did on tlie whole but little business tin evil lias and tlie number of the workmen has been again reduced However we still reckoned on good sale in the South of France and placed our hopes particularly on tlie fair of Bcaiicaire the celebrated in France but these are likewise disappointed The fair of Beaucaire at least in respect to those articles which interest our manufacture has been unfavourable beyond all expectation so tlie owners of the manufactories in Upper Alsace will see themselves reduced to the sad necessity of discharging tin greater part of their workmen Many even speak of giving up altogether THE CENSonSHIP--BY BENZEXBEnO In every the prevention of any thing being said injurious to Censorshi And second to prevent those subjects from coming
