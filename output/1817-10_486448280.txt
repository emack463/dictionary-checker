prerogative to be sure which must be exercised according to law and subject to the revision and correction of our cause shewn but no one we think will lie fool enoug to complain to the Court of Session of this amelioration of the sett of tlie Burgh of Montrosc By the old sett tlic Old Council chose the new now given on petition the Guildry at an annual open of tlie whole members have tlie nomination of their Dean of Guild and five other Councillors while the Craftsmen at an open meeting also have tlic privilege--of sending Convener and other three members the Council Ten out of nineteen members or majority of the Council which consists altogether of nineteen are thus elected by the annual suffrages of tlie Guildry and Craftsmen into the one or other of which bodies any inhabitant of the burgh may obtain admission for trifling sum of money And although we are far from saying that this is the best constitution of burgh which could be desired we persist in thinking it when contrasted with tlie former sett considerable step in the work of reform majority of the Council we have said is elected every year and every two years of course the whole Council is renewed by two numerous bodies from one or other of which no citizen is excluded The misconception then is on the part of our correspondent We continue also to hold that the Inhabitants of Montrose whose unwearied exertions country and we see no reason why of Scotland who in tins instance have yielded to receive all the credit that is due to them is due and honour to whom honour we neither obedience
