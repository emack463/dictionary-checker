fallen into tlie habit of overstraining his voice and giving way too often to that harsh snarl which originated with In Richard where it is his cue to play tlic dog His tones arc more rugged and uneven than ever in all impassioned scenes mar the mellowness of his pathos by the violence of tlic contrast He goes from the lowest note to tlie top of tlic compass at breath and returns as suddenly Tlie raven is not more that croaks his fatal entrance We lament that he indulges so extravagantly in tlie fury of his voice that it is so rough in its bellowing for revenge -that it so often happens rude throat the immortal Jove dread thunder counterfeits Its utterance is often precisely what means by rattling climbing sound of storm He not only speaks daggers as Hamlet does but Inspeaks guns drums trumpets blunderbusses thunder let him avoid these burs and botches in work We have mentioned this defect because it is the only serious one in his representation of Othello and we think lie may overcome it It is impossible to do justice to his performance in tlie third act of this immortal play -He is the troubled spirit of rude Cyprus and his heart is made of of this warlike isle The hints of lago drop like words of fire on In quick-and sensitive nature and turn all his thoughts to madness His stony look of jealousy is never to be forgotten and beggars all description His face hardens and the expression of one listening to tlie voice of an evil and unearthly spirit His eye fixes as though all this world fires The were gone and before him blew all its does not betray thoughts -it is the first sign tlie clenched fixed monumental look of one whose lips is adder- serpent- ed His words escape by the excess of agonized feelings -thcy are the natural sounds of Ilia tongue If any one direness familiar to his hung- out by haggard despair It is is become petrified with horror Each word from -and every thought in his own breast is as though they were forced out rather the convulsions of his lips than wishes to see perfect acting let him see KEAN in the third act of Othello -We have read over the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep the horror the despair of so fine and fearful something of different quality Champion what we have written and it is mild as compared with tlie language that ought to describe performance We must confess our incapacity -and turn to JEWS -In tract
