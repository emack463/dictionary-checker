TRIAL BY JURY IN CIVIL CAUSESThe Scotsman (1817-1858)TRIAL BY JURY IN CIVIL CAUSES In settling and adjusting question of fact when entrusted to any ingle Magistrate partiality and injustice have an ample field to range ri Here therefore competent of sensible and chosen by lot from among those of the middle rank will be ound the best investigators of truth surest guardians ot pubic justice BLACKS-TONE VE take up this subject which has already engaged ilie pens of the greatest judges and ablest lawyers in the not with the hope of being able to say any thing iew upon it but from suspicion that the experiment vhich has been made of it in this country is not upon with that favour which it deserves and from dread that we may lose the benefit of it altogether something be not done by those who are more able do it justice than ourselves to correct those against it which were never removed and that partly from those prejudices of it which has originated and partly from unreasonable The object of law in civil cases is to do justice those laws and forms are can be attained with the least delay and nst our former system of administering justice place in every litigated case attended it and the uncertainty in the end between man and man and the best by which this at the least expense The in Scotland were the great took the enormous expense which of obtaining right decision The great causes of these evils were the not separating the at the outset of causes private places by private persons in generally thought to be law from the the taking of evidence in writing in the to judge of

pleadings and would introduce more precision fully persuaded hat if it it would all these and many other excellent purposes Perfection however ought never to be With men for instruments the action of the machinery we have only to make the least looked for in my human institution will always be imperfect Beiwcen two systems of evils and we shall bo wise if we The loudest expense with which it is attended Tin is no many cases to denial of justice urging this objection here as if it did not force to litigation complaint at present against Jury Trial is the great doubt terrible evil amounting in but there is want of candour in apply with greater conducted under the older forms of court Jury Trial arc disputed and in such cases proceeding and affords we is not necessary except in cases where facts it is the least expensive mode of the better chances of obtaining justice of tlie Court when parties are much at variance by commissioner who has not profited counsel and who lias with or habits of the witnesses to be examined By tlic ordinary forms to facts proof must be taken by the earlier pleadings of probably little sympathy of tlic views feelings and before him And ifthis-he the case he cannot do justice in committing the evidence to to be matter of notoriety by the ripe on the subject as that of writing he cannot comprehend what is implied witnesses But even if his mind were-as judge who besides reading tlic pa- pers forming the issue had by counsel in public court in presence of an intelligent Jury or as well qualified as the jurors to comprehend the meaning of the witnesses still the commissioner could not take down as evidence that which though not spoken was plainly implied and obvious to every observer in the face and manner of the witness There is often more to be learned from witnesss manner the tone of his voice the expression of his features arid what these prove him to hold as true in In own mind than from the naked words emitted him and which are also riot very imperfectly or inaccurately taken down Here there is none solemnity nor of those concomitants which in an open court tend to control and overawe the person giving evidence If disposed to conceal or misrepresent or lessen by explanation what he has at me time said the most ample opportunities are afforded Iiirn by the time required to commit the answers to writing by the doubts started by the one or the other party as to the import of his expressions and the occasional blunders of the commissioner himself which necessarily require correction Much of the proof taken under commission too is led not because it is necessary to enable those wlio are present to know how the fact stands but to prevent the adverse party from on points which at the time and to all who saw are beyond controversy While the proof is going forward to resist tlie evidence of manner muscular is almost supposed to be proved than liberal feeling gets impatient of being urged to point to be guarded from objection His mind is impressed by evidence which for the time doubts or raising objections al an after period the witnesses examined it is impossible for the commissioner expression and implied meaning More appears afterwards from the written record Tlie commissioner from take down this explanation to allow this misconstruction or that from captious is irresistible but which is

leading proof on commission and mode of preserving evidence On the average of causes before Jury litigation in most instances at tlic end of proof The pleadings generally expensive beyond conception
