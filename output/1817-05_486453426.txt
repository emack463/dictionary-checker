Front Page 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)IN our second number we endeavoured to shew the infinite importance of the total emancipation of South America from the dominion of Old Spain as well to this country as to Europe in general The growing interest however which is now attached to the events passing in that continent has induced us again to call the attention of our readers to the same subject We cannot help thinking that the comparatively little sympathy the persevering efforts of the Patriots have met with from the British Public proceeds in considerable degree from the way in which this topic has been discussed in the public prints Almost all the Journals wlio have espoused the party of the Independents have dwelt on the advantages of American independence to this country in commercial point of view We do not certainly that such considerations ought to be overlooked but in our opinion they are subordinate to others still more deeply interesting If the flag of despotism were again to wave triumphant in the Spanish Colonies if the supremacy of the Inquisition were again to be restored in that country would not the chances of oppression of misgovernment and of arbitrary power be increased in every country of the world The whole body of mankind have an interest in the prosperity of freedom and in the progress of liberal ideas and every person ought to exert himself to suppress tyranny and Sliperstition wherever the twin brothers may rear their baleful heads There is no contagion so strong as that of example The formation of free states in any quarter of the world tends say or affect to say the establishment of one popular government despots They feel their power lessened they are -o standard by which to and circumspection when they are placed as it

having highly conduced to the best of mankind And just ef ng 6 fw at they owe WASHINGTON and the other men who consummated that great work ought to embalm their names in the recollection of the liberal and the wise of every country and of all succeeding ages The same principles obviously apply to the contest presently carrying on in South America It deeply affects every country in the Old World The success would not merely establish disgusting superstition and most oppressive tyranny in country inhabited by about 17 millions of Europeans and fully able to support in affluence and abundance more than ten times that number but it would materially and directly affect the liberties of other It would constitute precedent to which future despots would refer and the ill success of the patriotic cause in one country would infallibly weaken it JiraII This is not contest between two freemen and slaves between thc oppress and the satellites future happiness not only of America

cause of human nature against its-worst Although were in South America it can never any permanent America must grow in strength and as she becomes an oppressive domination Can it be with freedom constantly held up as momentarily to succeed in establishing his blasting despotism footing in that country Under any form of government stronger slic will be better enabled to shake off imagined that with the United States before their eyes mirror to reflect the comparative wretchedness of their own situation the people of this Continent will ever their efforts to obtain independence When the ideas freedom and of liberty arc never presented to the mind of of events that succeed other under an state and may be maintained without effort Oat when the public mind when this change aft cets the

independence of the colonies would really increase tlie power tlie wealth of Spain She could act more efficiently in Europe if slie had not to garrison an extensive continent Whatever force she
