Editorial Article 1 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)The address of General MINA to the people of Mexico which will be found in our preceding columns is rather an interesting document It alludes briefly to his military career in the Peninsula as Guerilla Chief and speaks of the subsequent acts of FERDINAND Government with that indignation which every generous and patriotic Spaniard must feel on the subject he explains the motives that induced him to embark in the cause of the Mexicans and is at no loss to reconcile the part he is acting with the princip les that led him to take up arms against the French The accounts of his proceedings since he landed in Mexico are rather contradictory While tlie Spanish Papers represent him as hemmed in with superior force and on the eve of destruction letters in the North American Journals state he was about to commence action under the most favourable auspices According to intelligence received from Havannah through the New York and
