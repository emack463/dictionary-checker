ON THE BEST MEANS OF INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF WATER FOR THE CITY OF EDINBURGHThe Scotsman (1817-1858)ON THE BF RT Of INCREASING THE SUP PLY 0 FOR THU CITY OF JiDlNliLKGII SIR -I was very much gratified by tlic sensible letter of Townsman on tlie scarcity of water and hi glad to find tli it it proves the incans of calling tlie public attention to tlie grievance lie complain of Indeed few tilings connected with our municipal surprised me more than tlic patience of tlie citizens of Hdinburgli under to an evil as tlie want of water and tlie of our rulers in not endeavouring to procure supply IIuiipor and thirst rouse tlic mildest animals to fury but the want of one of the prime necessaries of life cannot stimulate us to use llie simplest means for our own relief Ten or fifteen years elapsed since tlie of tlie supply began to be Mt complaints been made from time to time ever Bince and during the summers of 1814 and IBIS tlic scarcity was Yet no tiling done or promised to be done am not so unreasonable as to hold our Magistrates responsible for the accidents of the EeaMnn or to expect that they command the elements neither can suppose tint are to tlie comforts trifling privation which have felt in common with was experienced in long ago common sense Increase the of the city the share of by perpetual subdivision and an supply the ever so great Tlie root of lie con voice nt once prompts tlic activity and controls without this grievances the of those placed under authority or regard as others Hut surely when the want ol water taught them that the evil unavoidably individual too small even at drat must be daily diminishing must lie pot at no distant period lie the cost and ceive lies in the want of vigilant public ilia mismanagement of local authorities
