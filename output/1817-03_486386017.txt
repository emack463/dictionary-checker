Article 6 -- No TitleThe Scotsman (1817-1858)THE British Public have Mr since he came into Parliament as one of tlie most able and faithful champions of their rights and interests Though constant in his attendance in the House during tlie present Session he has not hitherto made those exertions which tlie important measures under consideration seemed to demand But he has now accounted for the employment of ins time His speech on the state of the country on- Thursday sc was noble effort and for comprehensive views sound reasoning luminous statement and weight of matter has seldom been Considered even as record of facts it is of inestimable value It affords an awful and by no means an exaggerated picture of unparalleled distress which has been brought upon tlie by the measures of Mr PITT and his successors The speech we understand has been published separately both in London and Edinburgh We it were read We wish the momentous truths it contains were impressed on the minds of all The enemies of reform may see in it tlic evils entailed tin this country by of an Parliament to an pled Administration Our Ministers may learn from it what they long seemed to doubt that it is possible to both tlie means and the patience of- he country The people who know the-truth it details experience will we trust take warning from it to tlic first attempts of ii rasli Minister to plunge them into desperate enterprises uwl vi-ill not in future suffer any political empiric to them pretexts into endless hostilities for objects in they have no interest and to Ktake tlie property and existence of tlic country 1 or the of tlic crazy despotisms of the Conlinciit Tho answer of Mr Runi soN is curious regulations are founded on exploded principles our industry But were an alteration by

to the on wars they might have some chance iTin in an rt would country is of very great importance Tlie variety of nets to shew tlic and Ill commercial point of view tlie Learned Gentleman lins condensed anil brought together it ruinous nature restrictive commercial system on we have been so long proceeding and lie has stated them ill ul perspicuous and convincing manner We deeply regret Mr should uny exception to Ills general principle If the agricultural interest is to be against forei gn competition-if we arc to be compelled to pay monopoly price for our food -for that commodity which is indispensable -it really dors not seem at all unreasonable the should insist on being dealt with in tlic same way Tlic effect of tlie corn laws if they any at must be to keep the price of up to 80 witli free trade it would not exceed 50 ii quarter But this of food having to be compensated to tlic working classes wage it is evidently and decidedly injurious primarily to their employers and to themselves Owing to tlie rise in the price of labour tlie price of manufactured goods must also be increased the demand for them is diminished and we are full convinced that very-great portion of the present distresses arises from this source If the people of Britain arc to live as comfortably as the people of tlic Continent they must at least receive double the sum of money in wages If it costs 1000 to weave given number of yards of muslin in France it must supposing the to be tlie same in both kingdoms and Mr admits this to be nearl the fact cost 2000 to execute the same work in this country This fact is undeniable It is impossible to raise and keep up the price of corn without at length raising and keeping up the price of labour And if we adopt fictitious system regarding bur trade hi the necessaries of life we may rest assured that we shall be forced to extend the same system to other departments We arc sorry MrBRouoiiAM should -have countenanced the delusive idea of the-late Corn La ortl principal necessary of life In diametrically opposite The more extensive ithc- supplies of food -the less is its of being two-thirds of the population of Holland have been prices at Amsterdam arc much steadier than in any other stead it is quite the same thing to low and if tlie landlords would recollect the price of having secured us permanent and independent our opinion its effect must be directly and -surface from which nation derives its exposed to scarcities and famine Nearly constantly fed with imported grain and yet tlie market of Europe If the prices of corn are fanners whether they nre or grain cannot be raised without producing corresponding effect on every other commodity they would and real advantage from such rise of prices easily perceive that they can

blessed witli steps from that preci and dangerous path which reducing our taxes It is useless to th fact is and far less sagacity than Mr BROUGHAM no free trade with the other-nations of tlic world Neither manufacturer nor an agriculturist burdened witli an different situation Tlie contrary supposition is absurd liberal trading system -if we are ever to withdraw our leads to certain destruction
