been as the of our liberties Blackstonc had truly that so long as this glorious ght of his country the Constitution could not be overthrown But right might he allowed to exist in form only that which it was not deemed expedient entirely to destroy might lie so sapped and calculated only to delude the understanding of those whose meant to protect Those whom he hnd ignorant of what had recently taken place and froin thence it must be obvious if to remove tlic evil of the essence of frittered away as to leave merely semblance liberty find property it was ori the honour to address could not be

serving than peri-onal emolument or private gain That such alone was tlic object of the majority of those persona it was impossible to doubt and he would appeal to common common sense whether such an exceptionable-system should be allowed to exist It was notorious that many persons derived certain profit from serving upon Special Juries and if any person or persons decided against-the Crown it was easy to judge what would be his or their fate if lie or they decide against the Crown in any case where tlic Advocate for the Crown had right to challenge This was serious consideration to trading Special Juror The Report which he was about to present contained many instances of tlic abuse resulting from this system which would lie liad-no-doubt astonish the Country-a- well as that Court In vindication of tlic system of Special Juries it was argued that upon important occasions it was necessary to have Jurors of superior rank and intellect but according to law and practice men in -the ordinary walks of life and of pl- iin were thought competent to decide upon charge of murder us well as any other capital offence With- whether the accused was guilty of murder or manslaughter

to doubt the improper construction of this Special Jury list was to were gentlemen of fortune who resided out or property within it Thus in the case of libel what was alleged or was to be decided by an Jury Other might be regarded as persons and many upon this unfortunate in trade lie was as little disposed encourage any prejudice against those wlio had fallen or recognise the right of such to determine upon any controversy between the Minister and obvious which should dispose to an opposite Juror which as lie had already observed list were known to be as any man to make illiberal remarks
