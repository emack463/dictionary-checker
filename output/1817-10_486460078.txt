necessarily from the course we followed during the war Ministers however pretend not to see the connection between these evils and our funding and taxing system but they are at no loss to discover that the termination of the war was the legitimate consequence of the wisdom and vigour of their measures This n- deed is the burden of their song on all occasions Their apologists push the assertion as far as it will go and- affirm that while others saw cause of dismay they were filled with confidence and while their opponents prophesied disaster their sagacity saw good fortune afar off that in
