THE SINKING FUNDThe Scotsman (1817-1858)THE SINKING FUND Tlw excess tf revenue expenditure is the only real ly which lie can tic discharged The increase of the or the of expense -ire tlio only means by which this sinking fund can be enlarged ind its operations rendered more cBl-ctual and all for the National Debt by sinking funds operating at interest or in any other manner in so far as they are founded upon this principle arc illusory Hamilton on National Debt JDn has so fully established the truth of tlie proposition just quoted to such of our readers as have studied Ins excellent work with the attention it deserves any thing we can offer in its illustration must have very-little interest But lie illusion respecting the sinking fund is still very genera and it is now evident it cannot be kept in motion without borrowing to the same extent Ministers and are daily forth its wondrous effects hi clearing off our encumbrances and in this Session of Parliament that he considered of the state We shall therefore lay before our on which this celebrated engine is the subject will excuse the of the discussion much better authority on such matters Mr declared its existence as conducing to the best interests readers 1 ew observations on the principles founded and wehope that the importance of which it necessarily involves is true that abstractly considered any sum magnitude ii lent out at compound the improvement of money in tins way would be Though however small will at length increase to any interest yet it is also certain as Di HAMILTON has observed limited to certain amount by the want of demand from borrowers and the impossibility of vesting it in restricted within much narrower limits by the mutability of system conducted by successive trustees is evidently essential in order to derive the payment of encumbrances by compound interest ing If this is the case obviously Le lost on the other productive capital of any kind And it is measures iind actual impossibility of adherence to tlic same through many generations But it any advantage from setting aside fund to effect no compound should be paid for the sums whatever is gained on the one hand and the country which hiid of debts in this way would find them increase more paying its rapidly than the sinking fund inasmuch as tlic expense of managing establishment would be dead loss expenditure exceeds its income and consequently it sinking fund was organised has been constantly unequal to meet the expenditure to pay the interest of the public debt and therefore interest Onr readers know tlic sinking fund is to having the interest added to it every year llic interest of the debt is added to its Now this is tlie case with every country whose lias been almost always die case with Great Britain since Mr The revenue during tlic last year or in other words we have borrowed in so fur increased that debt perform all its operations to form new capital and when former amount it must increase in as rapid ii progression At this rate how is it possible tlic one shall ever overtake tlic other Tlic sinking fund constitutes portion of tlic national managing it Like all the rest of the fabric money drawn from tlie classes liad oft tlic entire debt or until it was it remitted to the contributors tlic public could not though there was an uf can that of lio of debt standing in the name of paid for of it

debt existing in 1788 amounting to 238 millions is already paid oft This is altogether fictitious and delusive We may pay off as much debt as we please at any time by borrowing But tlic only real alteration in the state of our finance is tlie difference between the the former of exceeds the latter our situation is growing -S private gentleman whoso all his debt every year by more his free income his embarrassments will are so much tlie worse by debt contracted and the debt paid oft and while worse to the extent of difference is encumbered may if lie have any credit pay off borrowing from other hands but if lie spends increase and his affairs being conducted in this lie pays to li is agents Tlic absurdity of annual discharge of his debts will appear still stronger nor thc fees
