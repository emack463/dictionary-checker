before tlie Landrail or Corncrake The at which each species arrives at and departs fram the is chiefly dependent on tlie state of vegetation Thus Sweden when tlie bird-cherry came into leaf and when Nightingale accompanied witli tlie leafing of tlie elm later and some earlier and remain some longer some precedes tlie Swallow -tlie Swallow arrives before the Martin same variations occur in periods of departure The same country varies from one to four weeks ind this variation LINN KUS observed the Swallow returned to tlie wood anemone flowered He also found the arrival of tlie says that tlie Swallow returns to Norfolk tlie leafing of the sycamore It has also been observed is much to be wished observations of this kind were tlie Cuckoo sings when the marsh marigold blows It multiplied they

or tlie bird-catchers about London wlio take only Some species collect into nocks before and- tlie Woodcock The latter when to cross the adverse winds on which occasions they arc found in great excellent sport Oilier birds as tlie Cuckoo are supposed to go males of tlie Nightingale and some oilier species ten days before the females This is ascertained by males on tlie arrival of tins bird Tlie causes of these annual movements are supposed to be either tlie temperature or safe breeding place procuring of supply of food suitable Many of our summer visitants during the warm weather arc obliged to shift Cuckoo which feeds on tlie larva of large butterflies and on to take its departure early on account of lie by that time inclosed themselves preparatory to to enjoy which are taught by instinct of slimmer and southwards on the ch of winter so subsisting on insects are only to be found their quarters at the approach of winter to procure food The hairy caterpillars is probably obliged

agreeable to them Thus tlio Snow-bunting comes when it first arrives liere keeps the temperature sinks If carried into wurm room it through the winter if witli snow and kept in tlie temperature and with attention to this circumstance may be owing to sonic constitutional difference with respect to cold tlie arc stationary The same renders tlie Linnet us from ihe northern regions on the approach of winter high grounds but descends to lower level as tin in few days but it will live cold room Tlie Swallow again delights in preserved through tlie winter It is probably female Chaffinches in Sweden are migratory while the males is bird of passage in Greenland stationary with Another cause of these migrations seems to be tlie desire of obtaining Bate breeding Tli rc is to believe thai lie some species bred formerly in this country arc at present scarcely known Tlie Crane that bred country The Plover which is stationary in tlie western islands is mi-Rratrry in England is stationary in
