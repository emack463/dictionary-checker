RETROSPECT OF THE LATE SESSION OF PARLIAMENTThe Scotsman (1817-1858)RETROSPECT OF THE LATE SESSION OF PARLIAMENT maintain that unless the of the country were administered by the very worst of government it was breach of duty on the part of Ministers as well as of tin House to sit idle with arms across amidst such calamities as afflict the people and wait the course of events Mr Speech on the State 12 Session which lately closed was one of the most remarkable in the annals of this country It opened at moment when national calamity had reached hei ht which who knew the extent and stability of our resources must have beyond the range of possibility Neither mere misgovernment nor an unfortunate combination of circumstances could singly have brought an industrious and community into such state in truth less than both these causes united could have produc ed such degree of wretchedness The ruin- Had been so long approaching seemed at length to have overtaken TIS it spared no species of industry but crushed at once commerce manufactures and agriculture -involving thousands in the deepest misery The pressure of the numerous evils arising from this state of tilings as deficient crop and that deficiency not confined to Britain but common to most of the countries from which supplies might otherwise have been drawn In such circumstances some degree of to themselves jor every Javourabic event in the course of all the good or evil in their condition to the wisdom be matter of surprise that the Government should be held answerable discontent was unavoidable But as Ministers by taking credit had taught the people to refer or foll of their rulers it could not for some classes felt had been brought upon them aggravated general discontent and Ministers while they had to were pressed by another evil which touched in thp revenue It is evident then that portion of that distress which the industrious no misconduct of their own Thus general distress was rule country in this condition them still more sensibly -a great Parliament had great duties to discharge and great difficulties to encounter and it is equally clear that these difficulties calculated to try the test its pretensions to superior wisdom and firmness -to we have no doubt that this memorable facts strongly illustrative and duties were of kind peculiarly principles of Parliament itself -to bring to the patriotism and sympathy with the community Indeed Session will be referred to in all time coming as affording of the actual state of the British Government the country was in such state one would think Ilie Parliament together not done till the most rigorous When first stop should have been to call as early as possible This however was season of the year was over and till measures must have lost half their efficacy effect took upon themselves to decide that Parliament could do nothing instead of calling Ministers to account for their conduct Itliough it lid not dcc administered to the sufferings cf the country the speeches of the of relief liad they been adopted By this proceeding Ministers in to alleviate the public distress When Parliament did meet it seemed to have adopted the very same views for by formal resolution no relief could be members doubt that they wished the country to believe so and thus without even the form of investigation the conclusion seemed to be universally come to that ill the boasted resources of legislative wisdom of no avail in our wretched situation We shall on the ministerial side in both houses left no say at present as to the soundness of this doctrine but we must pause moment to reflect upon the important truth it discloses With the exception of the effects of bad harvest no candid man we -think will deny that considerable part of the distress of the country arose from the operation of those measures which for fiveand-twenty years preceding Ministers had suggested and Parliament sanctioned Whether those measures were wise at the time or the contrary we put entirely out of view The conclusion to which-we are conducted is quite obvious Ministers and ministerial majorities in Parliament in the exercise of the powers intrusted to them mny involve us in calamities from which they are utterly unable to extricate us We may suffer their errors but cannot depend upon their wisdom to repair he mischief they have done This proposition -so like truism buti obvious as in practice it is -we thin oYu forgotten when it would have baen mind JHad tins made due impression borrowing and subsidising for any object or no years Would we have gone on till we realised in the mouth of men who were our last shilling and our last drop of blood practise the same delusions we will recollect the severe lesson experience our advantage to bear it in would we have gone on-fi object as we have done for the last twenty-five expression so often growing rich on the substance of the country -of spending Let us hope that should another Ministry attempt to has taught us But notwithstanding the language held in Parliament there are many circumstances to warrant the could have done something to recollected that thE appeared in our to our manufactures an our foreign trade so fhr from being in its -parts circumscribed and no other object than of raising diminish the trade subject to their operation that others opinion that legislative measures mitigate-the public distress It will be foreign commerce roni- it Nbw when it is considered that state of natural freedom is in all positive enactments that many of these enactments having revenue must from their very nature cramp and of them were framed upon the miserable princip le of benefiting ourselves by obstructing similar measures on their part and that those enactments which were extending our own the reversed-when all this is considered we parts so full of error absurdity and especially at time when tlie relations of the change We cannot indeed hel believing statesman would have discovered that not in one but in the trade of rival nations or retaliating for framed witli tlic express view of improving and trade have in general tendency directly think it impossible system so artificial in all its should not admit of some beneficial alteration whole civilized world iia vti undergone so that nd many of its branches the withdrawing of prohibitory impost the modification or heavy duty the sacrifice of nn inconsiderable abolition of amount of revenue or an arrangement with some of the new powers not yet classed as legitimate pli ght have given an impulse to the national industry which would have done ten times more to renovate the health of tlie body politic than the paltry expedient of issuing Exchequer bills These views were admirably illustrated Mr BROUGHAM in his celebrated speech on the IStIi March in which lie entered into particulars witli relation to tlie Wine the Woollen and tlie Linen trade and shewed our enormous duties and injudicious regulations liad reduced some branches of trade one half and destroyed others altogether Ministers could not deny the of Ins statements They admitted that our commercial code was founded on wrong principles but they asserted the errors in which if abounded liad gradually ramified into system which was so fortified by tlie prejudices of particular classes that it could not be This was nearl equivalent had our practice been wrong in some few particulars it would have been while to correct it but since the whole system was vitiated it was wiser to let it alone Acting new-modelled the of Europe and extent Ministers found it would be Parliament ratified this judgment of Ministers with majority of 118 to 63 Mr inquiry into the salt laws experienced upon these views
